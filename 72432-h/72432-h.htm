<p>Six days out of seven, and nine hours out of
twenty-four, the reverend and learned Dr Gregory
Greendale sat surrounded with open volumes,
and immersed in profound thoughts, which ever
and anon he committed to writing. For twenty
years had this been his regular practice, and to
this dull monotony of being nothing could have
reconciled him but a strong sense of duty, seasoned
with a little spice of theological ambition.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
But his ambition was not for worldly honour or
for filthy lucre. His aspirings were not after
mitres, stalls, and deaneries, nor was his anticipated
recompense compounded, in his mind, of
pounds, shillings, and pence. Far purer and
sublimer motives prompted his diligence and
filled his hopes. It was his ambition to occupy
a distinguished station among the defenders of
the faith, and to be hereafter celebrated in the
records of ecclesiastical history as the most irrefragable
polemic that ever wrote or reasoned. It
was his opinion, that the church established by
law was the best and purest in Christendom;
and that if its tenets were fully and clearly
stated, accompanied with such refutation of sectarian
errors as he in his wisdom and logic
could furnish, all sects would be converted, and
all heresies expire for ever.</p>

<p>In this most laudable pursuit the doctor was
not altogether free from obstacles, disappointments,
and interruptions. Frequently when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
thought that he had only to sail quietly and
smoothly into harbour, a fresh breeze of controversy
sprung up, driving him out again into the
unfathomable ocean. Oftentimes when, after a
long, tedious, and multifarious series of references
and quotations, he fancied that his argument
had been completed, and the key-stone of
his logic immoveably fixed, he found that some
very unaccountable oversight, some trifling neglect,
let the whole fabric sink down in confusion.
And very, very many times, was the thread of
his argument snapped asunder by the intrusion
of the bustling, active, clever, managing, contriving,
economical Mrs Greendale. With one
of these interruptions our history commences.</p>

<p>As the study door opened, the doctor laid
down his pen, pushed up his spectacles and
lifted up his eyes, and Mrs Greendale entered
courteously, and gracefully smiling and saying—</p>

<p>“My dear, I don’t wish to interrupt you,
but—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>To which unfinished apologetic introduction
the worthy doctor in a more rapid manner, and
with greater asperity of tone than became a
learned divine and an affectionate husband, replied—</p>

<p>“You <i>have</i> interrupted me, Mrs Greendale.”</p>

<p>“There now, my dear, you are always so impatient,
you will never let me speak.”</p>

<p>Mrs Greendale was wrong; the doctor was not
always so impatient. But Mrs Greendale was
one of that countless myriad of persons who, in
their intense feeling of the present, too hastily
draw general inferences from particular facts.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said the doctor, “what is it,
my dear, that you wish to say to me?”</p>

<p>This was spoken in a more conciliating tone;
for the worthy polemic knew that the more gently
and quietly such interruptions were received, the
more likely they were soon to terminate. And
Mrs Greendale having now permission to speak,
was accordingly well pleased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>“Why, my dear, I was wishing to consult
you and to ask your advice on a subject of which
you must be a far better judge than I am.”</p>

<p>This was certainly a concession on the part of
Mrs Greendale; but unfortunately the concession
was not so highly estimated by the receiver
as the giver; and that is often the case with
concessions of this kind. The doctor was silent,
waiting for Mrs Greendale’s own enunciation of
her own story; for he well knew that impatient
questionings rather retard than accelerate the
progress of a narrative. Mrs Greendale then
proceeded.</p>

<p>“I have been thinking a great deal about
Penelope. Now, you know, we have of late
heard very little of her father, and there really
does not seem to be any prospect that he will
ever fulfil the fine promises he has made. And
we are not doing justice to the poor girl by
bringing her up with expectations that are not
likely to be realised; we are giving her an education
which is only justifiable under the idea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
that she should apply that education to the purpose
of supporting herself.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Mrs Greendale, it is with that
view, you know, that we have given her the kind
of instruction of which you speak.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know it is, but—but—”</p>

<p>“But what, my dear?”</p>

<p>“Why I was going to say, that though it may
be very proper that Penelope should have these
accomplishments, yet it may not be altogether
right that she should be introduced into the
society of persons of rank, on terms of equality
and intimacy.”</p>

<p>“Persons of rank, my dear—what do you
mean? What persons of rank are we likely to
introduce her to? Surely we are not in the way
of doing her any injury in this respect.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that, my dear; for you know
that we are to have a party to-morrow evening,
and Miss Spoonbill and Colonel Crop have consented
to come.”</p>

<p>The doctor did not laugh aloud; nor did he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
visibly smile at this last speech of his active,
bustling, managing partner. And it would have
been indeed excusable had the reverend divine
at least relaxed his features into a smile, at the
dexterity with which Mrs Greendale converted
the above-named lady and gentleman into persons
of rank. As these names have been mentioned,
it is proper that our readers should know something
of the parties.</p>

<p>Honoria Letitia Spoonbill was a maiden lady
of some forty, fifty, sixty, or seventy years old;
but in whose cranium the organ of number was
so slightly developed, that she could not say
which of the above numbers came nearest to the
truth. In person not fascinating, in manners
not commanding, in wealth not abounding, in
temper not prepossessing, in understanding not
profound; but in pride and vanity almost more
than superabounding. Her rank not the deepest
herald could ascertain, but it was very true that
for many years she had been accustomed to claim
kindred with the lord of Smatterton Castle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
always speaking of and addressing the Earl of
Smatterton as her cousin.</p>

<p>Colonel Crop was only Colonel Crop; he enjoyed
the rank of colonel, and that was all the rank that
he could boast; he was tolerated at the castle;
he dined occasionally with his lordship; and
occasionally partook of the pleasure of shooting
the birds which were cultivated on his lordship’s
estate. In town, he patronised the Countess’s
routs, and in the country he was a companion
for the Earl, when not otherwise engaged. He
was proud of the Earl’s acquaintance, though he
was not weak enough to suppose that he was
more than tolerated. The haughtiest of the
great do sometimes pick up such acquaintances
as Colonel Crop, and they cannot easily get rid
of them. At the village of Smatterton, of which
Dr Greendale was rector, Colonel Crop was
only known as the intimate friend of my lord;
but the doctor knowing the humble rank which
the colonel held in his lordship’s estimation,
was amused at the gravity with which Mrs Greendale<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
spoke of this gentleman and Miss Spoonbill,
as persons of rank, and as too magnificent
for the society of Penelope Primrose. With a
slightly ironical expression he therefore said—</p>

<p>“I quite agree with you, Mrs Greendale, that
it would not be very desirable to have our niece
intimate with such persons of rank as Miss
Spoonbill and Colonel Crop.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am glad you think as I do, my dear;
but how shall we manage about the party to-morrow?
How can we best get rid of Penelope?
For really I cannot help observing that, notwithstanding
her dependent situation, she begins to
assume the airs of a lady.”</p>

<p>Mrs Greendale was going on with all the
fluency of which she was capable, and that was
no trifle, to recommend the exclusion of the
young lady from the impending party which
threatened on the morrow to grace the rectory-house
of the village of Smatterton; but suddenly
the loudness of her tones abated, and the words
came slower, and her countenance looked blank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
with an expression of interrogation; for, as she
was speaking, the worthy rector drew himself up
to full sitting length, opened his eyes unusually
wide, compressed his lips unusually close, and
placing his hands in the arms of his chair, before
his spouse had ceased speaking, he exclaimed—</p>

<p>“My good woman, what are you talking
about?”</p>

<p>“Mrs Greendale certainly thought herself a
very good woman, but she did not like to be so
called. She was therefore somewhat confounded,
and she replied with an expression of confusion—</p>

<p>“But, my dear, did not you say yourself that
you did not wish your niece to be introduced to
persons of such high rank as Miss Spoonbill and
Colonel Crop?”</p>

<p>Speaking more slowly, and in a tone of expostulation,
the good man replied—</p>

<p>“I did say, Mrs Greendale, that I had no
wish to introduce my niece to an intimacy with
such persons of rank as Miss Spoonbill and
Colonel Crop. It is not to their rank I object,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
but I am of opinion that from such an intimacy
Penelope would not derive any benefit, nor add
to her respectability; I look upon her as above
them, and not upon them as above her.”</p>

<p>Mrs Greendale was angry; and surely it was
enough to provoke a saint to hear such disrespectful
language applied to those persons of
whose acquaintance the worthy lady was especially
and peculiarly proud. Bridling up therefore,
and assuming in her turn a high tone, she
replied—</p>

<p>“Well, my dear, if you think it beneath your
niece’s dignity to meet such persons, you had
perhaps better send word to say that you do not
wish to have their company: I dare say they will
not require much persuasion to stay away.”</p>

<p>“I wish, my dear, you would not talk such
nonsense. Penelope will not become very intimate
with these people of rank by meeting them
in a party. Have your party quietly, and let the
poor girl enjoy it, if she can; it will be time
enough for her to feel the bitterness of servitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
when she is actually in that condition; while she
is under my roof she shall be treated as if she
were my own.”</p>

<p>There was in this last speech a tone of authority
and decision to which Mrs Greendale was in the
habit of submitting without an audible murmur
or expostulation. She therefore left the doctor’s
apartment, merely muttering to herself, “I don’t
think you would indulge a child of your own as
you indulge this pert conceited creature. I am
very glad she is no niece of mine.”</p>

<p>The doctor returned to his studies, and Mrs
Greendale to her domestic occupations. The
doctor soon forgot what was past, losing himself
amidst the perplexities and intricacies of theological
discussions and doctrinal controversies.
But Mrs Greendale brooded over the obstinacy
of her spouse, and the pride of her niece, and the
mortifications of her own pride. She could not
imagine what her husband could mean by speaking
so disrespectfully of persons of such high
consideration as Miss Spoonbill and Colonel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
Crop. Ever since the high-born spinster had
taken up her residence at Smatterton, for the
sake of living near to her cousin the Earl, Mrs
Greendale had been paying homage to her for
the purpose of obtaining her illustrious notice
and patronage. It was a concern of the utmost
moment to have the honour of Miss Spoonbill’s
company at the rectory; for the wife of the rector
of Smatterton was very jealous of the superior
glory of the wife of the rector of Neverden, whose
parties were graced by the presence of the great
man of the parish, Sir George Aimwell, Bart. Mrs
Darnley, the lady alluded to, was not indeed quite
so much gratified by the distinction as Mrs Greendale
was mortified by it. Now it was some pleasure
to the latter that the great man in her
husband’s parish was an Earl, whereas the great
man in Mr Darnley’s parish was only a commoner;
for Mrs Greendale always caused it to be
understood, that baronet was not a title of nobility.
Still, however, it was a mortification that
the Earl would not condescend to visit at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
rectory. But when Miss Spoonbill and Colonel
Crop had accepted an invitation to Mrs Greendale’s
party, it was a matter of high exultation
to her; it was therefore not very agreeable to
her to hear these distinguished personages spoken
of so slightingly by her reverend spouse. But
Dr Greendale was an odd sort of man, that
everybody allowed; and he used to say the
strangest things imaginable. Being so studious
a man, was quite enough to account for his
oddities.</p>

<p>It may be proper now to give some account of
Miss Penelope Primrose, and to state how she
was brought into a state of dependence upon her
uncle, Dr Greendale. This young lady was an
only child of Mr Primrose, who had married
a sister of the rector of Smatterton. When he
married he was possessed of a very decent independent
fortune, which though not ample enough
to introduce him to the highest walk of fashion,
was quite sufficient to introduce him to the
notice of some part of the fashionable world, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
to bring him acquainted with several gentlemen
of the strictest honor; or to say the least, gentlemen
who made great talk about their honor.
With the acquaintance with these gentlemen he
was exceedingly flattered, and with their truly
elegant manners he was highly pleased. As
some of them bore titles, their condescension was
so much the greater, in not only tolerating, but
even in almost seeking his acquaintance; and
he found that there did not exist in the higher
ranks so much of that pride of birth and family
as some of his earlier friends had often talked
about. For as Mr Primrose was the son of a
merchant, some of his city intimates, and his
father’s old companions, had represented to him
that if he should assume the character of a man
of fashion, he would only be ridiculed and despised
by the higher ranks. He found, however,
that these censorious citizens were quite in an
error; instead of experiencing contempt and neglect,
he found that his society was actually
courted; he was a frequent guest at splendid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
entertainments, and his own invitations were not
refused. He observed, that although Mrs Primrose
was a beautiful and accomplished woman, it
was not so much on her account as his own that
he was so much noticed. The parties to which
he was most frequently invited, were gentlemen’s
dinner parties; and it was very likely that his
company was agreeable, for he had great powers
of conversation, and was a man of ready wit. It
was very pleasant to have his good sayings applauded
by men of fashion and of honor, and
he thought that the exquisitely courteous and
graceful demeanour of the higher ranks was the
very perfection of human excellence. In the
course of five years, or rather less, he found that
his style of living was rather too expensive for
his means, and upon looking into his affairs he
also discovered that he was in possession of
nothing that he could call his own, but that
when his debts should be paid, his coffers must
be emptied and his house unfurnished. He was
quite astonished at the discovery, and for awhile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
dreaded to communicate the painful intelligence
to his wife; but she had foreseen it, and the
anticipation had affected her deeply and irretrievably;
she sunk under the pressure, and left
Mr Primrose a widower with an only child. By
this calamity he was roused to recollection, and
he called to mind that he had occasionally played
at cards with some of his honorable friends,
and that he must certainly have been a greater
loser than he had imagined at the time. He
had at one sitting won upwards of three thousand
pounds, and he never afterwards sat down to the
table without being reminded of his good luck;
but it so happened, that when he went into an
examination of his affairs, he found that his
many smaller losses had more, much more, than
counterbalanced his once great winnings. Now
was the time for reflection, and so his friends
thought, and they left him to reflection. The
result was, that he committed the motherless and
portionless Penelope to the care of his brother-in-law,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
Dr Greendale, and betook himself to
commercial diligence in a foreign country, with
the hope of at least providing for himself, if not
of retrieving his losses.</p>

<p>Fourteen years had Penelope spent under the
roof of the worthy and benevolent rector of
Smatterton. To her uncle she had ever looked
up as to a father. Of her own father she knew
but little; and in all the thoughts she entertained
concerning him, there was mingled a
feeling of pity. It was highly creditable to
Dr Greendale, that his manner of speaking
of Mr Primrose should have produced this impression
on his daughter’s mind. There certainly
was in the conduct of Penelope’s father enough
of the blameable to justify the doctor in declaiming
against him as a profligate and thoughtless
man, who had brought ruin upon himself and
family. But censoriousness was not by any
means the doctor’s forte. He was rather a moral
physician than a moral quack, and he had found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
in his own parish that the gentleness of fatherly
admonition was more effectual than the indignant
eloquence of angry rebuke.</p>

<p>Penelope naturally possessed high and buoyant
spirits; and had her situation been any other
than that of dependence, it is probable that this
vivacity might have degenerated into pertness.
It was however softened, though not subdued
by the thought of her father in voluntary exile,
and the language in which Dr Greendale was
accustomed to speak of his “poor brother Primrose.”
Her spirit also was humbled, though
not broken, by the stepmother-like behaviour of
Mrs Greendale. Penelope could never do or
say anything to please her aunt. When she was
cheerful, she was reproved for her pertness;
when serious, she was rebuked for being sulky.
At her books, she was proud of her learning;
at her pianoforte, she was puffed up with useless
accomplishments. Out of the kitchen she was
too proud for domestic occupation, in it her
assistance was not wanted. In her dishabille she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
was slovenly, when dressed she was a fine lady.
By long experience she grew accustomed to
this studied annoyance, and it ceased to have
a very powerful effect upon her mind; and it
might perhaps be the means of doing her
good, though its intention was anything but
kindness.</p>

<p>As the mind and feelings of Penelope Primrose
were impelled in different directions by her
natural constitution, and by her accidental situation,
a greater degree of interest was thus attached
to her character. There is in our nature a feeling,
from whatever source arising, which loves not
monotony, but delights in contrast. The tear
which is always flowing moves not our sympathy
so strongly as that which struggles through a
smile; and the sun never shines so sweetly as
when it gleams through the drops of an April
shower.</p>

<p>To introduce a female character without some
description of person, is almost unprecedented,
though it might not be injudicious; seeing that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
then the imagination of the reader might fill the
vacant niche with whatever outward, visible form
might be best calculated to rouse his attention,
to fix his sympathies, and to please his recollections.
But we are not of sufficient authority to
make precedents. Let it be explicitly said, that
Penelope Primrose exceeded the middle stature,
that her dark blue eyes were shaded by a deep
and graceful fringe, that her complexion was
somewhat too pale for beauty, but that its paleness
was not perceptible as a defect whenever a
smile illumined her countenance, and developed
the dimples that lurked in her cheek and under-lip.
Her features were regular, her gait exceedingly
graceful, and her voice musical in the
highest degree. Seldom, indeed, would she indulge
in the pleasure of vocal music, but when
she did, as was sometimes the case to please the
Countess of Smatterton, her ladyship, who was
a most excellent judge, used invariably to pronounce
Miss Primrose as the finest and purest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
singer that she had ever heard. More than
once indeed the Countess had recommended
Penelope to adopt the musical profession as a
sure and ready means of acquiring independence;
but the young lady had scruples, and so had
her uncle.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>


<p>It has been said in the preceding chapter, that
Dr Greendale resumed his studies as soon as Mrs
Greendale left his apartment, and that he soon
forgot the interruption and the discussion which
it had occasioned. After a little while however
he found that the train of his thoughts had been
seriously broken, and that he could not very
easily or conveniently resume and connect it. He
therefore determined that he would for a few
hours lay aside his pen, and indulge himself with
a little relaxation from study. These occasional
relaxations are very essential to authors, especially
to those whose writings are the result of
deep and continuous argumentative thought.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
The doctor indeed had found this to be the case
to a much greater extent than he had anticipated:
for, when he first busied himself upon his great
work, he thought that three years would be the
very utmost of the time which he should occupy
in the labours of the pen. But it so happened
that he spent so very large a portion of those
three years in the pleasing employment of looking
to the honor and glory which lay beyond them,
that they were absolutely gone before he was
well aware of it, and his important and momentous
labours were only begun; he had scarcely
laid the foundation of that magnificent superstructure,
which was destined to be an immortal
and unfading monument of his theological and
polemic glory. And even long after the expiration
of the first three years, he found it necessary
to rouse himself to extraordinary, and almost
convulsive diligence by preaching some very eloquent
discourses on procrastination. In these
discourses he quoted Young’s Night Thoughts;
and most of his parishioners thought the quotations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
exceedingly fine; but Mr Kipperson, of
whom more hereafter, quite sneered at them, and
afterwards told the Earl of Smatterton’s gamekeeper,
that Young was nothing of a poet compared
to Lord Byron. But, notwithstanding all
that the worthy rector of Smatterton had said,
thought, or preached, concerning procrastination,
he could not help now and then indulging himself
and laying aside his pen, just for an hour or
two; it could not make much difference; and besides
it would not do to be always writing; there
must be some interval allowed for thought. In
one of these intervals, now accounted for by the
interruption of Mrs Greendale, he sent for his
niece Penelope; for he thought that in Mrs
Greendale’s present humour the young lady would
feel herself more at ease in any other company
than that of her diligent and managing aunt.</p>

<p>Well it was indeed, for the dependent one, that
this humour of relaxation seized the doctor at
this moment: for Penelope had met Mrs Greendale
on her return from the doctor’s study, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
had, in as considerately gentle, and humble
terms as possible, proffered her assistance in
making preparation for the morrow’s party; and
Mrs Greendale, instead of receiving the offered
aid courteously, as it was proposed, only replied:</p>

<p>“I beg, Miss Primrose, that I may not take you
away from your studies. Besides, it is not quite
correct that guests should provide for their own
entertainment.”</p>

<p>Much more to this purpose said the angry wife
of the rector of Smatterton, and Penelope bore it
as patiently as she could. From this discussion
however she was soon and most agreeably relieved
by a message from the doctor, commanding,
or more properly speaking, requesting her attendance
in the study.</p>

<p>Hastily but not rudely she quitted the paragon
of domestic managers to attend to the best of
uncles, and the keenest of polemics. When she
entered the doctor’s room, she found the books
closed, and the pen laid down, and the chair
moved, and the fire stirred, and a chair cleared of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
its literary lumber and put on the opposite side
of the fire-place for her to sit down upon. These
were pleasant symptoms, and pleasanter than all
were the kind and amiable looks of her uncle.</p>

<p>“Penelope, my dear, if you are not very much
engaged I should like to have a little conversation
with you. But, perhaps, you are helping your
aunt to prepare for tomorrow?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I am not, for my aunt does not want
any help. I was offering my assistance when
you sent for me, but my aunt declines it.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!—Well then sit down, my dear, sit
down. Have you been practising this morning?
I have not heard you. You must learn that new
song before you go to the castle, for it is a great
favourite with Lady Smatterton.”</p>

<p>“I have practised this morning, and I sang it
over two or three times after breakfast. I think
I know it now quite perfectly.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good girl. But I cannot say I
wish you to make a business of singing. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
always very well for an amusement but no farther.
The Countess is very kind to you, and you
ought to oblige her as much as possible; yet I
would not wish that you should give your exclusive
attention to that science.”</p>

<p>“I have no such wish myself, sir; I feel very
much embarrassed and confused even when I sing
at the castle, when no one is present but Lord
and Lady Smatterton. I am sure I could never
bring myself to perform in public.”</p>

<p>“Very good; you have a very proper feeling
on the subject. I know the Countess would be
very happy to bring you out under her patronage,
and very respectable patronage it would be; but
I have very great objections to such publicity for
a young person like you.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear uncle, I have been thinking—I
have been thinking—”</p>

<p>Penelope, in thus speaking, hesitated and
blushed, and trembled, and a tear would have
been seen starting into her eye, but the doctor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
observing that she was confused, did not look at
her to increase her confusion. Suspecting what
was the cause of this embarrassment, he said:</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, my dear, I know what you have been
thinking about, and I have been thinking of the
same subject. You think it very strange that
you have not heard from Robert Darnley.”</p>

<p>The doctor was right, and the doctor was
wrong. Penelope had indeed been so thinking,
but it was not of these thoughts that she was
then about to speak. The suspicion however
increased her confusion and she wept. Sobbing,
she exclaimed with great earnestness:</p>

<p>“Oh no, my dear uncle! I had no such meaning,
but I was going—”</p>

<p>The doctor heeded not these words, but proceeded
to say, with much tenderness of manner:</p>

<p>“But, my dear Penelope, you should not
make yourself uneasy. Foreign letters are frequently
delayed and detained from a variety of
causes. I dare say you will soon have a sufficient
explanation of this silence. I have often had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
your father’s letters two or even three together,
after waiting a long while, and fearing that the
correspondence had ceased.”</p>

<p>Penelope recovered her voice and more composedly
replied; “Indeed, sir, it was not of
Robert Darnley that I was going to speak; I was
about to say that it was now time for me to go
out into the world and no longer to be burdensome
to you.”</p>

<p>“Burdensome to me, my dear child, how can
you think of such a thing?”</p>

<p>“But, sir, it is painful to be in a state of dependence
when one has the means of doing something
for a maintenance. I am sure, my dear
uncle, you would not mention the subject to me,
and so I am compelled to speak first.”</p>

<p>“A state of dependence is a state in which we
all are. We must be dependent on one another, it is
the ordering of a wise Providence; it is the means
by which we have the development and exercise
of some of our best and purest feelings. Beside,
you are yet too young to teach others, you have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
not finished your own education, you want experience.
Pray do not talk of leaving me. If you
say any more on this subject I shall be afraid
your home is irksome.”</p>

<p>This was the most effectual appeal that could
be made to Penelope; it silenced, but convinced
her not. It is true that her home was irksome. It
was annoying to her in spite of all her constitutional
vivacity and acquired philosophy to be
continually exposed to the open or covert reproaches
of Mrs Greendale. For this very clever
lady had exercised management in everything
but in the government of her own temper. And
true it is, though strange it may appear, that her
own opinion of her own temper and habit of mind
was exactly the converse of reality; so when we
see our image reflected by a looking-glass, that
which is our right hand appears as our left, and
that which is our left appears as our right. Mrs
Greendale thought herself a model of candour
and good humour; and whenever she uttered reproaches
against Penelope, which was not very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
seldom, she actually thought and believed that
all the fault was in the young woman’s perverseness,
vanity, or affectation, whereas the only
fault was in her own distempered vision, which
could see nothing good in her, against whom, for
some unaccountable cause, she possessed a decided
prejudice. For a mind thus constituted,
there was obviously no remedy; Mrs Greendale
could not profit by indirect hints, nor could she
see in others of the same temperament a portraiture
of herself. It was also in vain that Penelope
attempted to please her; that was an absolute impossibility,
and the dependent one had found it
so by long and bitter experience. The poor girl
therefore was not of opinion that she was burdensome
to Dr Greendale, but she felt that Mrs
Greendale was burdensome to her; she found
that her elasticity of spirit was diminishing; she
began to assume the air and aspect of one tried
with far deeper troubles than the continual wearisomeness
of undeserved reproaches. Though occasionally
Dr Greendale had perceived something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
of this, and though he had given some gentle
hints to that purpose to his better half, yet he
had no idea of the extent to which the annoyance
reached, and of the bitter pains of heart and
spirit which it occasioned to his niece. The art
of ingeniously tormenting was once made the subject
of a lively little book, but the art is not to
be learned; it comes as the spontaneous growth of
the mind, and Mrs Greendale knew the art much
better than the witty author of that treatise.</p>

<p>We have explained the situation in which
Penelope was placed. But as every condition
of humanity is more or less of a mixed nature, so
in her state there were some alleviations. Her
kind-hearted and benevolent uncle, so considerate
and so gentle in his manner towards her,
partly counterbalanced the pain which she experienced
from the behaviour of her aunt. He was
constantly endeavouring to encourage her with
hopes that her situation was not destined to be
for ever a state of dependence. He was perpetually
dwelling upon the brightest view of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
father’s prospects; and though Mr Primrose had
now been fourteen years in India, and during that
time had sent to England very little more than
promises and flattering hopes, yet the worthy
doctor was pertinacious in cleaving to the conviction,
that his brother-in-law would eventually,
and perhaps very soon, fulfil his promises, and
realize the hopes which he had excited. As for
himself, the uncle of Penelope would willingly
have adopted her as his own, but this adoption
would have been serviceable only during his
natural life; for he had scarcely anything to
call his own beyond the income of his living.</p>

<p>In the situation of Penelope there was also
another circumstance, which might be said to be
an alleviation; but which, in some of its bearings,
was a source of deep anxiety. Robert Darnley,
the son of the rector of Neverden, had very early
in life, by means of strong interest, been appointed
to a situation of great promise in India; and two
years before the time of which we are writing
had made a visit to England; during this visit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
an acquaintance had been formed between him
and Miss Primrose, and this acquaintance was
not met by any opposition on the part of the
young gentleman’s parents. Mrs Greendale could
not imagine what Mr and Mrs Darnley could see
in Penelope to make them so partial to her, and
she thought that a young man of such talents
and prospects might make a far better match than
with a young woman whose only portion was her
pride, and a few useless accomplishments; for in
this point of view did she regard her niece, or, to
speak according to her own most frequent manner
of expression, Dr Greendale’s niece. Mrs
Greendale, to be sure, did not oppose the match,
but she could not help giving a few hints as to
the unreasonableness of the expectation that
Penelope should consider the rectory as her home
till she should be married. For, as the good
lady well observed, there is no accounting for
these young sparks, they may change their minds
a thousand times; and then in such case what
would the young woman be fit for, after living in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
expectation of becoming a fine lady, and at last
being compelled to earn her own living? It may
be imagined, and it might be described, how unceasingly
eloquent was Mrs Greendale on these
topics; and it may also be imagined that no
great delicacy would be used as to the manner
in which such precautionary reflections and admonitions
were administered by the prudent and
knowing wife of the book-loving rector of Smatterton.
And as the worthy doctor gave himself
up so closely to his studies, his dear wife took it
for granted that he must be a mere ignoramus as
to all worldly matters, and therefore she endeavoured
to supply the deficiencies of his knowledge
by the redundancy of her own.</p>

<p>Pleasing then as it might be to Penelope Primrose
to look forward to competence and independence
with one for whom she entertained a
reverence as well as an affection, yet, in spite of
her confidence in the mental stability and good
sense of her destined husband, it was impossible
not to be in some degree affected by the perpetual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
and unceasing repetition of hints and insinuations
concerning human fickleness and juvenile
inconstancy; more especially when these hints
and insinuations were somewhat corroborated by
the fact, that latterly the epistolary communications
had diminished in frequency.</p>

<p>From these circumstances it may be then easily
inferred, that Penelope was not in an enviable
situation, and that nothing could have supported
her spirits but that exceedingly strong propensity
to bright hopes which is the characteristic of the
youthful mind, and about which moralists, and
essay-writers, and other wiseacres, make such a
prodigious and prosy preachment. Mr Malthus
himself could not desire a more effectual mean
of thinning the denseness of population, than
causing every mind, if it were possible, to form
such a view of future days as should be actually
realized by the event. But it never will be so,
and it never can be so; Providence is wiser and
kinder than moralists and essay-writers; and
Providence has given to the young that brightness
of hope, the pleasures of which are far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
greater than the pains of disappointment. The
very disappointments of maturer life bring with
them some pleasurable alleviation, in the eloquence
and pathos with which we sigh and
lament over the deceitfulness of the world’s promises;
and thus there is a double good derived
from a single evil. For youth is pleased as it
looks forward to manhood, and manhood is
soothed and instructed as it looks backward to
youth.</p>

<p>We do not like to finish a chapter with a sentimentality
clap-trap, therefore we turn from our
digression to inform the reader, that the interview
between Dr Greendale and his niece terminated
in reconciling the latter to a longer residence
under her uncle’s roof, and in convincing
her that the non-arrival of letters from India
would be very satisfactorily accounted for; so
that Penelope looked forward to the party engaged
for the next day with a degree of pleasure,
and a portion of hope that Mr or Mrs Darnley
would explain the long silence of their son.</p>

</div>


<p>“A party in a parlour,” to quote an expression
from the author of Peter Bell, is to a clever,
active, and managing woman, a very serious and
important matter. If then on the morning of
that day which was destined for the reception
and entertainment of Colonel Crop and Miss
Spoonbill, Mrs Greendale should be extraordinarily
full of business, and in proportionable ill-humour,
it were not to be wondered at. This
was very naturally anticipated by Penelope, who
endeavoured as well as possible to provide against
it. As soon therefore as breakfast was over she
put on as cheerful a look as she could well
assume, and asked Mrs Greendale to give her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
leave to assist in preparing for the evening entertainment;
and to her very great astonishment,
instead of meeting with a rebuff, she was answered
with great civility, and her offer was accepted;
and even her opinion was asked concerning
divers ornamental arrangements of the supper
table. The cause of this phenomenon it is our
duty to explain.</p>

<p>Our readers then are to be informed, that on
the preceding day, almost immediately after the
interview and dialogue between Mrs Greendale
and the doctor concerning Penelope, the angry
lady of the rectory went to call on Miss Spoonbill,
in order to make assurance doubly sure, as
concerned the longed-for visit. At this lady’s
house, Mrs Greendale had the pleasure of seeing
Lord Spoonbill; and as his lordship was a very
affable young man, he condescended to take great
notice of Mrs Greendale, and to ask particularly
after the doctor and his niece. In the course of
conversation Mrs Greendale cleverly contrived to
let the young lord know that there was to be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
party at the rectory the following day, and that
Miss Spoonbill and Colonel Crop had kindly condescended
to honor the humble roof of Dr Greendale
by their presence; at the same time she
also ventured to express how much they would
be honored and how highly gratified if his lordship
should not happen to be better engaged, and would
favor them with the pleasure of his company.
To her inexpressibly agreeable surprise, his
lordship unhesitatingly accepted the invitation.
“Now a fig for Mrs Darnley,” thought Mrs
Greendale; “I shall have a lord for my guest.”
This it was that put Mrs Greendale in such good
humour. Penelope soon received from her aunt
the information which we have communicated to
our readers, and with that communication she
also had a request from the good-humoured and
managing mistress of the rectory, that she would
see that the pianoforte was in tune, and that her
music-books were in order, because his lordship
was excessively partial to music. It was absolutely
impossible for Penelope not to comply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
with this courteous request, and she promised
that the music should be all in proper order,
though she knew that she should be under the
disagreeable necessity of performing some stupid
duets, in order to give his lordship an opportunity
of displaying his own little knowledge of
music.</p>

<p>Lord Spoonbill was the only son and heir of the
Earl of Smatterton. At the time of which we are
writing, this promising youth had just finished
his education at the university of Cambridge, or
more properly speaking at the joint universities
of Cambridge and Newmarket; for the latter is a
kind of essential appendix, or chapel of ease, to
the former. It is indeed a great piece of neglect,
and grievously impeaching the wisdom of our
ancestors, that Cambridge only of the two universities
is blessed by the vicinity of a race-course;
seeing that our hereditary legislators are in many
cases more fond of applying the knowledge
which they acquire at Newmarket, than that
which they gain, if it be any at all, at the university<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
of Cambridge: and if there be any truth in
the observation, that the best kind of education
is that which is applicable to the purposes and
pursuits of after-life, then indeed Newmarket may
be called the better half of Cambridge. Lord
Spoonbill was not one of those careless young
men who lose at the university what they have
gained at school; one reason was, that he had
little or nothing to lose; nor was his lordship
one of those foolish people who go to a university
and study hard to acquire languages which
they never use, and sciences which they never
apply in after-life. His lordship had sense
enough to conclude that, as the nobility do not
talk Greek, he had no occasion to learn it; and
as hereditary legislators have nothing to do with
the exact sciences, it would be a piece of idle impertinence
in him to study mathematics. But
his lordship had heard that hereditary legislators
did occasionally indulge in other pursuits, and
for those pursuits he took especial care to qualify
himself. In his lordship’s cranium, the organ of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
exclusiveness was strongly developed. We do
not mean that his head was so constructed internally,
as to exclude all useful furniture, but that
he had a strong sense of the grandeur of nobility
and the inseparable dignity which attaches itself
to the privileged orders. The only instances in
which he condescended to persons in inferior
rank, were when he was engaged at the race-course
at Newmarket, or when he found that condescension
might enable him to fleece some play-loving
plebeian, or when affairs of gallantry were
concerned. In these matters no one could be
more condescending than Lord Spoonbill. We
should leave but an imperfect impression on the
minds of our readers if we should omit to speak
of his lordship’s outward and visible form. This
was an essential part of himself which he never
neglected or forgot; and it should not be neglected
or forgotten by his historian. He was tall
and slender, his face was long, pale and thin, his
forehead was narrow, his eyes large and dull, his
nose aquiline, his mouth wide, his teeth beautifully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
white and well formed, and displayed far
more liberally than many exhibitions in the metropolis
which are only ‘open from ten till dusk.’
His lips were thin, but his whiskers were tremendously
thick. Of his person he was naturally
and justly proud. Who ever possessed such
a person and was not proud of it?</p>

<p>Now when this superb and elegant specimen of
nobility condescended to patronize Mrs Greendale’s
party, was it not enough to account for the
exquisitely high spirits in which the good lady
appeared, and for the unparalleled courtesy with
which she accepted the offer of her niece to assist
in preparation for the evening’s entertainment?
Penelope herself was very much pleased; for
though she had often endeavoured to persuade
herself that she did not heed Mrs Greendale’s ill-humours,
yet she could not help feeling the difference
between good-humour and moroseness. It
is not pleasant to be always within hearing even
of the snarling of a dog, or the creaking of a rusty
hinge, and far less pleasant is the language and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
tone of human censoriousness. The young lady
was not only pleased with her aunt, but she also
regarded Lord Spoonbill with some degree of approbation.
Of his lordship indeed, she knew but
little, save that when she passed him he used to
stare at her with great rudeness and earnestness.
That was not agreeable; but, for aught her simplicity
knew to the contrary, such behaviour
might be the mark of that superiority of mind
which so exclusively belongs to persons of rank.</p>

<p>Penelope was also in good spirits at the thought
of meeting Mr and Mrs Darnley, from whom it was
possible that she might hear something of Robert
Darnley; for though she had frequently said to
herself, “I am sure he has forgotten me,” yet she
did not believe herself when she said so. Most
highly proper and suitable was that feeling; for it
was possible that the neglect was only apparent and
not real; in such case, therefore, common candour
required the most favorable view of the matter.
It should be stated, that Smatterton and Neverden
were adjoining villages, both of them at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
some distance from the high road, and Neverden
was in the line between Smatterton and the
nearest post town. The letters were carried by a
great lubberly boy, called Nick Muggins, who
rode upon a little half-starved weazel-faced animal,
that might pass for a horse, ass, or mule;
but the poor animal was so grievously insignificant,
that the inhabitants of Neverden and Smatterton
did not even take the trouble to decide to
what species it belonged. But let that pass.
Now Nick Muggins was not one of the best readers
in the world; he had unfortunately left school
before he came to that part of his education.
There is many a man of letters who does not know
how to read. In consequence of this defect, Nick
was forced to call in the aid of the more learned,
and it was not unfrequently the case that when
he asked Mr Darnley, saying; “Please sir, what’s
the ’rection of this here?” that if the letter was
for Penelope, Mr Darnley would take it of the
boy and carry it to Smatterton in the course of
the day, and especially when no letter came for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
himself from the same quarter, as he was anxious
to hear from his son by every opportunity. In
hopes therefore that Mr Darnley would make
himself doubly welcome at Smatterton, Penelope
kept up her spirits. So the day passed over very
brightly and calmly; and before the shadows of
evening had descended, Mrs Greendale’s party
began to assemble.</p>

<p>No newspaper announced to the world Mrs
Greendale’s rout, nor did the hospitality of the
rectory disturb the neighbourhood by the rattle of
carriages, the glaring of torches, the thundering
of knockers, or the impatient vociferations of
coachmen and footmen. Of the party, we have
already mentioned Miss Spoonbill, Colonel Crop,
and Lord Spoonbill. Mention has also been made
of Mr and Mrs Darnley; but nothing further has
been mentioned than their names. As it is desirable
to know one’s company, it may not be unsuitable
in this place to introduce to our readers
more particularly and descriptively Mr and Mrs
Darnley and family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>The Rev. Robert Darnley was rector of Neverden,
having enjoyed the living about five and
twenty years at the time of which we are writing.
He was a most zealous churchman, and was
thought by some persons of more lax and complying
principles to be rather a bigot. In his
manners there was no lack of courtesy, though to
a casual observer he might seem rather proud and
haughty. He certainly did entertain a very high
sense of the dignity and importance of the clerical
office; and even those who censured his stately
manners bore willing testimony to the activity
and zeal with which he discharged his clerical
duties; and the more creditable to him was this
testimony, inasmuch as he never appeared in the
character of a preferment-hunter. He almost
entirely confined his labours to his own parish,
and though the living was small and his own property
was ample, he was as attentive as if his
subsistence depended on his parish. Some of
his friends used to say that his professional income
was altogether expended in charity. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
was a man therefore of much influence in his
neighbourhood, and indeed it was often remarked
that he seemed to be a greater man than Sir
George Aimwell himself; and in truth, if moral
dignity has anything to do with greatness, he
certainly was.</p>

<p>Mrs Darnley was the best-tempered woman in
the world; not very remarkable for anything else
than for her good-humour, which was imperturbable
and imperishable, and for the remains of great
personal beauty, or rather prettiness. Their family
consisted of one son, of whom we have
already spoken, and of three daughters, who were
educated by Mr Darnley himself, and therefore
were more distinguished by the depth of their
learning than the extent of their accomplishments.
Happy was it for them, and happy for
their father, that they possessed minds capable
of doing justice to a literary education. They
were not pedants nor prigs. To Penelope Primrose
they were invaluable friends, and one or
other of them was an almost unceasing companion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
to her. The name of the eldest was
Anne; of the second, Mary; and of the third,
Martha. Mary was most distinguished for talent,
Martha for imagination, and Anne for good humour
and practical good sense. If there were
any difference in the degree in which the young
ladies were devoted to literary pursuits, perhaps
the eldest was the least zealous. It does indeed
not unfrequently happen, that increasing years
abate the fervour of literary pursuits, from shewing
us the vanity of mental labour, and teaching
us how little we can learn, and how limited must
be our knowledge even in its utmost possible
range. We do not, however, design to insinuate
that Miss Darnley was far advanced in years, or
that her knowledge had reached, or even closely
approached, the practical limits of mortal acquirement.
We are merely making the best apology
we can for the young lady’s but moderate thirst
for literary distinction.</p>

<p>There was one however of Mrs Greendale’s
party against whom no charge of indifference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
to literature or science could be justly brought.
It was Peter Kipperson, Esq. This gentleman,
though in middle life, had not abated aught of
his zeal for learning. He was a man of very
great intellectual ambition. His views were not
confined to any one branch of literature, or
directed exclusively to any one science. As an
agriculturist he certainly took the lead in his
county; and being, as it was currently reported,
“a capital scholar,” he was the composer or compiler
of all resolutions and petitions touching the
interest of corn-growers. His opinion was asked,
and his expressions quoted as authority on all
matters connected with land, or stock, or grain.
If any ingenious mechanic had constructed or invented
any new machine, the invention was worth
nothing till it had the sanction and patronage of
Mr Kipperson. But he was not a mere farmer:
he was also a man of letters. He had one of the
largest libraries in the neighbourhood; besides
which he was a subscriber to a public library in
the metropolis, from whence he had all the new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
publications as soon as they came out. He had
read far more than Mr Darnley or Dr Greendale:
the former of whom he called a high priest, and
the latter a mere pedant. On the great men of
the two villages, Lord Smatterton of Smatterton,
and Sir George Aimwell of Neverden, he looked
down with great contempt as very ignorant men;
and though Lord Spoonbill had been at Cambridge,
Mr Kipperson was quite sure, from the
obsolete constitution of the universities, that nothing
could be taught there that was worth
knowing. He therefore thought Lord Spoonbill
a very superficial and ignorant man. To the pursuits
of literature Peter Kipperson added a profound
love of science. The plain farmers, when
they called upon this genius, were astonished
at the very knowing aspect which his library
wore; seeing, that besides the numerous volumes
of elegantly bound books, which were ranged on
shelves surmounted with busts of Milton, Shakspeare,
Cicero, &amp;c. &amp;c., there were globes, maps,
electrical machines, telescopes, air-pumps, casts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
skulls, chemical apparatus, and countless models
of machines of every description, from steam-engines
down to mole-traps. The glories of Peter
are yet untold. Wearied as our readers may be
with the monotony of panegyric, they must, if they
continue to be our readers, undergo yet more, and
be told, that Mr Kipperson was a great judge of
music. He could play on the flute and on the
pianoforte; but he thought nothing of his performance
compared with his judgment. He had once
at the opera witnessed the performance of Don
Giovanni, and from that moment became a critic.
Furthermore, Peter was a perfect gentleman, and,
to crown all, a man of patriotic principles;—though
it has been whispered that his politics were conveniently
adapted to those of the Earl of Smatterton
and Sir George Aimwell. It does sometimes
happen, as some of our readers may know, that
in some parts of Great Britain the little gentry
copy the politics of the great gentry or nobility
of their neighbourhood. Mr Kipperson, with all
those amiable and estimable qualities, was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
single man. He consoled himself, however, with
the reflection that Lord Bacon and Sir Isaac
Newton were unmarried.</p>

<p>The above-named, with divers others, formed
Mrs Greendale’s party; and when they were assembled,
the worthy lady found herself perplexed
and puzzled by the grandeur of her guests.
There were three persons present to whom she
would fain have given, if it were possible, her undivided
attention. Lord Spoonbill was one of the
three. His lordship, however, did not seem disposed
to draw very liberally on the attention of
the lady of the house; for, as soon as he entered
the rectory drawing-room, he lounged up to Mrs
Greendale, whom he honored with a nod, turned
round to the Doctor, whom he recognised with a
smile, said to the Colonel, “How do ye do,
Crop?” and then thew himself almost at full
length upon a sofa, as if those to whom he had
addressed himself were vanished, and as if there
were no one else in the room. By degrees, however,
he condescended to recognise one, or two,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
or more of the party. Of Mr Kipperson he asked
the price of wheat, and Mr Kipperson asked what
his lordship thought of Mozart’s opera of Don
Giovanni. His lordship admired it prodigiously,
but he condescended to say very little on the
subject; whether it was that he had but little to
say, or whether he thought that such an universal
genius as Mr Kipperson could not receive any
new light from a Cambridge man. The great
agriculturist, finding that his lordship was not eloquent
on the subject of music, assailed him again
on the subject of Don Juan, as versified by Lord
Byron, and his lordship being rather weary of
the company and questions of Mr Kipperson,
stared him full in the face, and with an affected
smile, said:</p>

<p>“’Pon honour, Mr—Mr—I—I am not a reading
man.”</p>

<p>Mr Kipperson thought his lordship somewhat
rude, and perhaps might have been disposed to
challenge him, only he feared that he might be
disappointed, and hear his lordship exclaim,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>“’Pon honour, Mr—Mr—I—I am not a fighting
man.”</p>

<p>Lest by any perverseness of apprehension the
interrogator of his lordship might be induced to
proceed in his unwelcome familiarities of approach,
the heir of Smatterton rose from the sofa
and took his station at the pianoforte, where Miss
Primrose had been with much persuasion vainly
endeavouring to place Miss Martha Darnley.
Now Lord Spoonbill did not like to hear Miss
Martha Darnley so well as he liked to hear Miss
Primrose; and the three reasons which determined
him are such as for their soundness must approve
themselves to all our readers. In the first place,
the politics of Mr Darnley were opposed to the
politics of Smatterton castle; in the second place,
Miss Martha Darnley was not so pretty as Miss
Primrose; and in the third place, Miss Primrose
was by far the best performer of the two.</p>

<p>It was a great relief therefore to his lordship
that Miss Primrose was absolutely compelled to
take her place at the instrument, and it was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
great pleasure to him to see that when the leaves
of Mozart’s Don Giovanni were turned over there
was a pause when the young lady came to the
duet of “<i>La ci darem</i>.”</p>

<p>“That is a beautiful duet, Miss Primrose,”
said his lordship.</p>

<p>“Will your Lordship take a part in it?” replied
Miss Primrose.</p>

<p>“With the greatest pleasure,” responded his
lordship: and as his lordship was speaking, Mr
Kipperson approached the musical group, and
was about to repeat his well-known commentary
on Mozart’s music, when, at the instigation of
Lord Spoonbill, the music began. He only made
two or three blunders through the piece, and
Miss Primrose very mercifully concealed them
when she could, and accounted for them when
she could not conceal them.</p>

<p>In like manner his lordship went through several
other duets, as historians speak of battles
being fought, “with various success.” In like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
manner his lordship kept Miss Primrose engaged
at the instrument nearly the whole of the evening:
so that no one else could enjoy the use of the
pianoforte, or be favoured with the company of
Miss Primrose, or the charms of his lordship’s
conversation. But Mrs Darnley, after long and
anxiously watching an opportunity to speak to
Penelope, came near to the instrument, and
whispered loud enough to be overheard by Lord
Spoonbill, “We understand that the Warley is
arrived off Portsmouth, and we shall no doubt
have letters tomorrow or next day.”</p>

<p>It was rude in Mrs Darnley to interrupt the
musical people, and it was condescending in Penelope
not to be rudely inattentive, especially as
she was listening also to compliments from a lord.
But Penelope Primrose was one of those high-spirited
young ladies who think nothing of titles.
She was thankful for the information which Mrs
Darnley communicated to her; but while she felt
thankful for the matter she was somewhat troubled
by the manner of the information. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
was an expression in Lord Spoonbill’s countenance
which signified that he not only heard but understood
the nature of the communication which
was thus made. Very true, it was nothing to his
lordship, but still it was not pleasant to Penelope
to have this information conveyed to her in the
hearing of a third person. She therefore blushed
most burningly.</p>

<p>Now Lord Spoonbill was quite as capable of
behaving politely as of behaving rudely; and he
never did either the one or the other without
abundant reason and motive. It was not at this
moment part of his system to behave rudely.
Very kindly therefore he took no notice of the
blushes of the young lady, and very naturally
he spoke about Mrs Darnley and the rector of
Neverden. He spoke of them in such terms of
recommendation as were not best calculated to
recommend them. This is an ingenious artifice
too well known to require explanation, and too
villanous to justify us in saying a single word
that should contribute to render the practice more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
facile. The language had an effect on Penelope,
of which she was scarcely aware. She had a feeling
of undefined and unaccountable uneasiness,
and the very intelligence which Mrs Darnley had
communicated did not give her that unmingled
pleasure which she had anticipated. The evening
passed off not so pleasantly as the day had
done.</p>

<p>While Miss Primrose was engaged at the
pianoforte, Mrs Greendale was endeavouring with
all her powers to entertain Miss Spoonbill. In
these endeavours the poor lady laboured with
more zeal than judgment. It is a common, but
very foolish, practice for little folks to assume
greatness, in order to recommend themselves to
the great. It never answers, nor is it likely that
it should. For what is the use and benefit of
rank if it be not to separate and distinguish the
superfine part of the species from the general
mass of mankind? And whence arises the pleasure
of this distinction but from its rarity. Who
would care to be a duke amidst a whole nation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
of dukes, or who feels himself honoured by the
title of esquire? Instead therefore of listening
with complacency to the harangues of Mrs Greendale,
and the talk of her own or her husband’s
alliance to nobility, Miss Spoonbill most perversely
directed her conversation to the prospects
of Penelope Primrose.</p>

<p>“Your niece has a most delightful voice, Mrs
Greendale; I think it a great pity that she does
not take the advice of my cousin, the Countess,
and make use of her musical talents. She would
come out under very great patronage.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so, madam,” replied Mrs Greendale
rather hastily: “but as Miss Primrose is the
doctor’s relative, and not mine, I do not presume
to interfere with my advice as to the disposal of
the young lady. Indeed I do not know that there
will be any absolute necessity for her having recourse
to any occupation.”</p>

<p>“I understand you, Mrs Greendale; but let
me advise you as a friend not to suffer any foolish
expectations of that nature to prevent the young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
woman from making use of her talents for her
own maintenance. Young women are dependent
enough at best. It would be better for them
rather to increase than to diminish the means of
making themselves independent. It is not wise
in young women to depend on the speculation
of marrying, for thus many poor things are forced
into marriages which are productive of anything
but happiness. My cousin, the late Earl of
Smatterton, and his most excellent Countess, used
always to give it as their advice to young people,
not to speculate on the chance of marriage;
and the present Countess is of the same opinion.”</p>

<p>Miss Spoonbill thereupon launched out more
fully and freely into divers discussions concerning
portionless females, and administered much
advice, more valuable than welcome, to Mrs
Greendale. We will put it to any of our readers
whether they would be greatly pleased, if, after
taking pains to procure the visiting countenance
of a person of high rank, the said personage, instead
of visiting on terms of equality, should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
presume to play the part of a dictator? Mrs
Greendale was therefore disappointed, and that
most grievously.</p>

<p>Much more conversation than we have recorded
passed at the rector of Smatterton’s evening
party, but we do not think it necessary to
give more to the world. For if by any accident
such conversation should find its way into a library
for the people, it is possible that the people would
not thereby be very greatly edified, nor add much
to the reverence which they feel for the clerical
order and profession.</p>

<p>The party at the rectory was not kept up to such
a late hour as to prevent Lord Spoonbill and
Colonel Crop from riding over to Neverden the
next morning to take a day’s shooting with Sir
George Aimwell, whom we shall have great pleasure
in introducing to our readers.</p>

<p>Sir George Aimwell, of Neverden Hall, Bart. was
descended from a long line of illustrious ancestry,
and was a wholesale poulterer, and one of
the great unpaid. Not that we mean by this expression
to insinuate that the retail poulterers did
not pay him for what they had: we merely mean
to say, that the preserve-worshipping, spring-gun-setting,
poacher-committing baronet administered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
justice for nothing; and, with reverence
be it spoken, that was quite as much as it was
worth. Perhaps we may do our country a piece
of service that shall immortalize us, if we suggest
by the way a great improvement on the present
system of justice-mongering. Let not Mr
Hume imagine that we are going to recommend
that the country justices of the peace should be
paid for their valuable time and invaluable labours.
A far better plan would be, that they
should pay for their places, and that the magistracy
should be given to the highest bidder. For
surely it is worth something to have authority,
to be able to accommodate or annoy a neighbour,
to commit a poacher, and to keep a whole village
in awe. It is worth something also to be
called “your worship.” This however is a digression.
Not that we apologize for it, but rather
take to ourselves praise for communicating so
much valuable information in so pleasant a style.</p>

<p>To proceed then with our description of Sir
George Aimwell. The worthy baronet was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
most active magistrate, peculiarly acute in matters
of summary conviction; and thinking it a great
pity that any rogue should escape, or that any
accused, but honest man, should lose an opportunity
of clearing his character by means of a jury
of his fellow countrymen, he never failed to commit
all that were brought before him. There was
also modesty in this; for he thereby insinuated
that he would not take upon himself to make
a decision in these cases, but would leave the
determination to the judges of assize and the
wisdom of a jury. Sir George professed Whig politics;
these were hereditary in his family, but by
no means constitutional in him as an individual.
Therefore he passed for a very moderate Whig;
for one who would not clog the wheels of government.
In short, he was no more a Whig than a
game preserver ought to be; and that, as our
readers know, is not much. He took especial
pains to keep the parish clear of vagrants and
paupers; and by his great activity he kept down
the poor-rates to a very moderate sum. The excessive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
zeal and satisfaction with which he exercised
the magisterial functions led us to the
recommendation which we have given above.
Sir George, though a professed Whig, was not
very partial to the education of the lower orders,
and he always expressed himself well pleased
when he met with a country booby who could
neither read nor write. For this reason Nick
Muggins, the post-boy, was a great favourite
with him. Our worthy baronet could not see the
use of reading, and he thought it a great piece of
affectation for country gentlemen to have libraries.
His own books, for he had a few, were
huddled together in a light closet, where he kept
his guns and sporting tackle. There was a Lady
Aimwell, wife to Sir George; but this lady was a
piece of still life, of whom the neighbours knew
nothing, and for whom her husband cared nothing.</p>

<p>Colonel Crop was quite at home with Sir
George Aimwell, and so he could be with any one
who kept a good table. Shooting was not any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
great pleasure to the colonel, but as he could not
sleep all day long, and as the dinner hour did not
hurry itself to accommodate him, he was content
to walk about the fields with a gun, and say
alternately yes or no to the various wise remarks
made by Lord Spoonbill or Sir George Aimwell.
Let no one despise Colonel Crop for this most
useful of all social qualities, a decided and settled
acquiescence in all that his feeders may please to
assert. The colonel belonged to a profession
the glory of which is to obey orders. If therefore
he carried this spirit into all his intercourse with
those whom he considered his superiors, it is
neither to be wondered at nor to be blamed.
We do not wish to speak disrespectfully of the
army; it is very useful in war and very ornamental
in peace.</p>

<p>The morning’s sport was not good, and therefore
the worthy baronet was sulky and ill-humoured,
and kicked his dogs; and he made use
of such language as is very unfashionable to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
print. Colonel Crop re-echoed the unprintable
exclamations of the great unpaid, but Lord Spoonbill
did not seem to heed the sport, or more properly
speaking the want of sport. It is very
provoking to be in a passion with anything that
thwarts our humour, and it is still more provoking
to find another, who ought to be in a passion
with the same object, regard the matter with
total indifference and unconcern. Thus provoked
was the worthy and exemplary magistrate Sir
George Aimwell. His red face grew redder, and
his magisterial looks became more majestic; at
length, with a due degree of deference to one of
noble rank, he began to utter something like
reproach or expostulation to Lord Spoonbill.</p>

<p>“Upon my word, Spoonbill, this may be very
good sport for you, but it is not so for me. I
never saw the birds so shy or the dogs so stupid.
But you seem to be very easy about the matter.”
Then turning to the colonel, he continued: “I
suppose his lordship is thinking of old Greendale’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
pretty niece.”—At this speech the baronet
laughed, and so did the colonel. Who could
help laughing at it?</p>

<p>Lord Spoonbill smiled, and only replied in an
affected drawl, “By all that is good, Sir George,
you must think me a great simpleton to be
caught by a pretty face. The fact is, I am not
much of a sportsman, you know. I could enjoy
a <i>battue</i> very well, but this hunting about for a
few stray birds is poor work.”</p>

<p>“A <i>battue</i>, forsooth!” exclaimed the amiable
baronet:—“I believe those villains the poachers
have scarcely left a single bird in the Cop-wood.”</p>

<p>The worthy magistrate was going on, but his
indignation at the shocking violation of those
most excellent laws which the wisdom of our ancestors
has formed, and the folly of their descendants
has tolerated, so entirely overcame his feelings,
that in the violence of his anger he incurred
the penalty of five shillings; but his companions
did not inform against him. In a word, he swore
most bitterly and tremendously. Our readers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
must not blame him too hastily for this transgression.
Let them consider that he was a
magistrate, and of course very zealous for the
due observance of the laws. Swearing is certainly
wrong; but that is a mere trifle compared
to poaching: the uttering of a single profane
oath being, in the eye of our most excellent laws,
precisely one-twentieth part of the crime of an
unqualified person having in his possession a
dead partridge.</p>

<p>When the baronet had relieved his bursting
heart, and vented his swelling indignation in the
mode above named, and when Colonel Crop had
sympathetically joined him in the execration of
the transgressors of our most excellent and equal
laws which regard the arrangement of game, then
did Sir George proceed:</p>

<p>“Could you believe it, Spoonbill?—You know
the pains I have taken with that wood—I say,
could you believe it, after all the expense I have
been at about it—after having six men sitting up
night after night to watch it, that in one afternoon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
and that in broad daylight, it should be
almost cleared by those infernal villains?”</p>

<p>Here the baronet became angry again, and no
wonder; it was beyond all endurance. Not
only did he as a magistrate feel grieved at the
violation of the laws, but as a gentleman and a
man he was pained at the loss of those birds
which he seemed born to shoot. The birds were
gone and the poachers were gone; the first he
could not shoot, and the last he could not commit.
And what is the use of living in the country, if
there are no birds to be shot and no poachers to
be sent to gaol?</p>

<p>Pitying the sorrows of the magistrate, Colonel
Crop replied, “Too bad, ’pon my honor.”</p>

<p>But Lord Spoonbill having recently quitted
the university, in which he had been taught to
investigate and seek out the connection of cause
and effect, enquired:—</p>

<p>“But how could the rascals do all this without
being detected, if you had men to keep the wood
by night and day?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>“I will tell you,” said the baronet, whose violence
seemed a little abated by the kind sympathy
of his friends: “it was entirely owing to a
rascally gamekeeper of mine, who, no longer ago
than last Sunday week, instead of attending to
his duty, must needs go sneaking to church. I
saw the fellow there myself. He absolutely had
the impudence to come into church when he
knew I was there. I dismissed him however at
a short notice. I was determined to have no
church-going gamekeepers.”</p>

<p>“That going to church was abominable,” said
the colonel.</p>

<p>“But I thought you had always guns in your
plantations, Sir George?” said Lord Spoonbill.</p>

<p>“So I have,” replied the magistrate; “but
unfortunately the guns had been discharged in
the morning on some boys and girls who had
gone to look for nuts; and as one of the boys was
nearly killed, the under keeper took it into his
fool’s head that he would not charge the guns
again; so I gave him his discharge.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>“You have been very unfortunate in your servants,
Sir George.” So spake the colonel, who was
more than usually eloquent and voluble; and Sir
George was especially delighted with him, for he
seemed to enter so fully into all the magistrate’s
feelings upon the subject of game and poaching.</p>

<p>It is astonishing that, notwithstanding all the
pains which the legislature has taken upon the
subject of the game laws, which are so essential
to national prosperity and the Protestant succession,
still there is a possibility that gentlemen
may be deprived of their sport by the intervention
of a poacher. The laws are too lenient by
half; and till it is made felony without benefit
of clergy to be suspected of poaching, we shall
never be free from this dreadful calamity. Our
legislators have done a great deal, certainly; but
they ought to take up the subject with as much
zeal as if the cause were their own.</p>

<p>Now while Colonel Crop was sympathising
with Sir George Aimwell on his great and serious
calamity, Lord Spoonbill was gradually withdrawing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
himself from his companions, and moving
towards the side of the field which lay nearest to
the road, and looking with great earnestness in
the direction of the village of Neverden. It was
not long before his eye caught the object for
which he had been looking. There came clumsily
cantering towards him a quadruped, the appearance
of which would have puzzled Buffon, and
on its back there sat a biped as unclassable as
the beast on which he rode. The two were
usually called Nick Muggins and his pony. Lord
Spoonbill took great pains to see Nick by
accident.</p>

<p>“Have you any letters for the castle, Muggins?”
said the heir of Smatterton.</p>

<p>“Isser,” replied Muggins, and forthwith he
produced two letters, one of which was addressed
to the Right Honorable the Earl of Smatterton,
and the other to the Right Honorable Lord
Spoonbill.</p>

<p>“I will take charge of them,” said his lordship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>To which proposal Nick Muggins made no
objection. His lordship then, just by way of
condescendingly noticing the humble post-boy,
said—</p>

<p>“There now, I have saved you the trouble of
riding any farther, unless you have any letters
for the parsonage?”</p>

<p>“Here is one, sir, for the young lady as lives
at Parson Grindle’s.”</p>

<p>Muggins looked rather significantly at Lord
Spoonbill when he thus spoke, and his lordship
replied—</p>

<p>“You may give that to me, and I will take care
of it.”</p>

<p>What arguments were used to induce this
breach of trust in the guardian of the Smatterton
post-bag, is not stated, nor known, but conjectured.
Muggins, when he had given the letter
to his lordship, looked rather hesitatingly, and as
if he wished to speak; his lordship interpreted
his looks, and said, “Well, what are you waiting
for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>To this interrogation Muggins replied with a
cunning simper, “Why, please, sir, my lord, on
case of any questions being axed, perhaps your
lordship, sir, will just-like get a poor boy off,
you know, my lord.”</p>

<p>“Bah!” replied his lordship, “leave that to
me.” And thereupon those arguments were used
which had been of such great and decided efficacy
in previous cases of the same nature. The undescribable
rider of the undescribable beast then
turned about and went homewards, and the heir
of Smatterton soon rejoined his sporting companions.</p>

<p>Lord Spoonbill was now in possession of two
letters more than did of right belong to him;
and though he had taken great pains to become
possessed of at least one of them, and though he
was glad that he could prevent the information
which they contained from reaching the destined
point, still he was not altogether comfortable.
Once or twice he determined that the letter designed
for the parsonage of Smatterton should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
reach its destination, and then he as often
changed his mind again. It may seem strange,
and perhaps be thought not true, that an hereditary
legislator should descend to such meanness
as to intercept a letter. It is indeed strange,
and but for its strangeness it would not be here
recorded. But Lord Spoonbill was one of those
decided characters that do not let trifles deter
them from pursuing their schemes. He was
rather proud of the dexterity and address with
which he pursued any object on which he had
fixed his mind, and he mistook, as many other
prigs do, obstinacy for firmness. He had fully
made up his mind to a certain end, and he was
not choice as to the means. Yet he was a man of
honor, a man of the nicest honor, a man of the
most sensitive and susceptible honor. If any
one had been capable of calling him mean, if any
one so bold as to have expressed the slightest
idea that his lordship was a contemptible fellow,
with what indignation would he have heard and
repelled the suspicion. His notions of honor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
must have been very curious and quite unique.
We wish it were in our power to present to our
readers an analysis of those views which Lord
Spoonbill took of the principles of honor. We
are not equal to a task so truly philosophical: we
can only say that his lordship did descend to
the meanness of intercepting a letter, and did call
and think himself a man of honor. If any of
our readers think that this is very paradoxical
and altogether improbable, we congratulate them
on their ignorance.</p>

<p>We cannot help at this part of our narrative
shifting the scene for a little moment, just enough
to shew our readers the effect produced in another
quarter by the conduct of the above-named
man of honor. From the sportsmen at Neverden
we turn to the rectory of Smatterton and its inhabitants.
Dr Greendale was in his study as
usual, not kept away by any weariness of the
preceding evening. Mrs Greendale felt more
acutely the trouble of company departed than of
company coming, and Mrs Greendale was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
selfish in her sorrows, but communicated them to
all about her. Penelope Primrose felt the full
weight of her aunt’s troubles; and as the good
lady of the rectory had been rather disappointed
the preceding evening she was not in one of her
best humours. Patiently as possible did Penelope
bear with those ill humours, for her mind
was buoyed up with hopes of pleasing intelligence
from abroad. The hour arrived which
usually brought the postman, but no postman
arrived. It was possible the clocks at Smatterton
were too fast. The hour was gone by, a full
hour was past. It was not probable that the
Smatterton clocks were an hour too fast. There
was a little hope that Mr Darnley might be at
Smatterton in the course of the morning; but the
morning passed away and Mr Darnley did not
come. But a messenger came from the rectory
of Neverden with enquiries after Dr and Mrs
Greendale. Penelope asked very particularly
after the rector of Neverden and Mrs Darnley,
and hoped that they arrived safely home, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
that they had taken no cold, and—and—just as
a matter of curiosity, had they heard from their
son lately? The answer was, that a letter from
Mr Robert Darnley had arrived the very hour
before the messenger set out. Penelope turned
pale, and then blushed most intemperately, because
she felt how pale she looked; and then
she thought—“Now I know he has forgotten me.”
Immediately after however she thought again, and
then it occurred to her that, as Robert Darnley
was remarkable for his great filial affection, it was
possible that he might have had no time to write
by that conveyance more than one letter. But
she still could not help thinking that he might
have sent her one small letter: if it had been but
short, it might have been a memorial of his
thoughts still dwelling upon her. She felt hurt,
but would not be angry; and hoped, very
earnestly hoped, that she was not cherishing a
foolish and fond passion for one who had relinquished
all fondness for her. It was very strange
and altogether unaccountable. It was so very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
much unlike the usual frankness and openness of
mind for which Robert Darnley was so remarkable.
These were painful thoughts, and the more
painful because so very perplexing. It is somewhat
wearying to exert the mind very diligently
and perseveringly, even in solving problems and
guessing riddles which are mere abstractions;
but when, in addition to the perplexity, there is
personal and deep interest and moral feeling, then
the agitation and weariness of the mind is at the
highest.</p>

<p>Penelope found her accustomed resource in
trouble, and her consolation under life’s perplexities,
in the kind and paternal attention of her
uncle. She spent the greatest part of the afternoon
of that day in Dr Greendale’s study, and
listened with great pleasure to the fatherly exhortations
of that most excellent man; and, as
she was afterwards heard to observe, she thought
that he spoke more like an angel than a man.
She treasured up in her heart the hope that the
morrow would bring tidings from the beloved one.</p>

<p>Sir George Aimwell and his companions found
but little sport in the field, and it was not unpleasant
to Colonel Crop to hear that it was now high
time to leave the birds and to adjourn to dinner.
This was a relief also to the baronet himself; for
though he was a keen sportsman he never suffered
the amusements of the field to interfere
with the duties of the dinner table. Colonel Crop
was aware of this laudable peculiarity in the
manners of Sir George of Neverden, and therefore
enjoyed a day’s sport with him far more than he
would have done with another.</p>

<p>Those of our readers who know the worthy
baronet need not be informed of the superior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
style of his culinary arrangements. It was very
well for him that his table had this attraction, for
it is very certain it had no other. His own conversation
was by no means the most brilliant.
Lady Aimwell might indeed be capable of conversing,
but the guests of Sir George never heard
her voice, excepting so far as it was absolutely
necessary that some words must be uttered by
the lady who presides at the head of a table.</p>

<p>Speaking of the intellectual accomplishments
of the magistrate of Neverden, we may not be
considered as making a needless digression if we
narrate an anecdote, or rather expression, a critical
expression, of the worthy baronet. Mr Peter
Kipperson, the wise and knowing agriculturist of
Smatterton, one day dined at the table of Sir
George of Neverden hall. Now Peter was a
very literary man, who thought there was nothing
worth living for but science and literature; and
having somewhere read that it was impossible to
take shelter in a shower of rain with such a man
as Burke, without discovering him to be a man of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
genius, Peter was desirous of continually showing
off, and was instant in season and out of season.
Therefore when sitting at the table of the worthy
baronet, he assailed the magistrate with various
scientific subjects, but all to no purpose; there
was no response from his worthy host. Endeavouring
to adapt himself to the moderate talents
and circumscribed reading of the baronet, he next
started the subject of novels and novel reading,
taking care to insinuate that, though Sir George
might not read the trash of circulating libraries,
he might be acquainted with some of our
best novels. To this at last the baronet replied—</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I remember many years ago reading
a novel called Tom Jones, written by a Bow-street
officer. I recollect something about it—it was
very low stuff—I forget the particulars, but it
was written in the manner of servants.”</p>

<p>Hereupon Mr Peter Kipperson set it down as
an indisputable fact that baronets and magistrates
were the most ignorant creatures on the face
of the earth, and he congratulated himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
that neither he nor Sir Isaac Newton were
baronets.</p>

<p>Our readers may therefore very well imagine
that if we pass over in silence the dinner at
Neverden hall, where sat Sir George and Lady
Aimwell, and Colonel Crop, and my Lord Spoonbill,
we are not transgressing the truth of history.
Soon after the cloth was removed, Lady Aimwell
made herself invisible, and Sir George made himself
what he called comfortable.</p>

<p>“Now, my good friends,” said he, “you know
my way. Pray take care of yourselves. Pass
the bottle. There—now—well—you know—I—sometimes—it
is very rude—you—I know you
will—excuse”—</p>

<p>Saying, or muttering as above, the guardian of
laws and game sank to sleep in his easy chair,
and left Lord Spoonbill and Colonel Crop to
amuse each other. They were however very bad
company, for one had no good in his head, and
the other had nothing at all there.</p>

<p>Lord Spoonbill smiled at the baronet in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
easy chair, and Colonel Crop smiled also. Colonel
Crop looked at his lordship most imploringly, as
if to beg that he would say something to which
yes or no might be replied; but the heir of Smatterton
was more deeply engaged in his own
thoughts. Colonel Crop filled his glass and
emptied it, and cracked nuts, and picked his
teeth, and took snuff, and yawned, and looked at
the pictures, and looked at his own fingers, and
put them into the finger glass, and took them out
and wiped them. Lord Spoonbill filled his glass,
and did not empty it, and did not look at the
pictures, and he took out his watch and put it
into his pocket without looking at it. Of many
events it is said, that they are no sooner said
than done. But all these movements took up a
much longer time in doing than they have in the
reporting. It was a great relief to the colonel
that Lord Spoonbill looked at his watch, for
that enabled the man-of-war to say, “What time
is it?”</p>

<p>Lord Spoonbill answered by guess, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
colonel was not very particular. When about
half an hour more had elapsed, the heir of Smatterton
rang to order his horse, and he said to the
colonel, “Crop, I shall leave you to play at
backgammon with Sir George. Make my apologies.
I have some matters to attend to at the
castle.”</p>

<p>Lord Spoonbill then took his departure from
Neverden hall. It was a fine moonlight night,
and the road from Neverden to Smatterton was
peculiarly well calculated for the enjoyment of a
moonlight ride. The domain of Neverden was
for the most part on low and level ground; and
the road from the hall towards Smatterton lay
partly by the side of the park, over the low fence
of which a person on horseback might have a most
beautiful view of plantation scenery, and a distant
glimpse of lofty and swelling hills, dark
with abundant foliage, but softened by indistinctness
and remoteness. The ground then gradually
rose, and on the left hand might be seen at no
great distance a broad and gracefully undulating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
river, far indeed from the sea, but bearing on its
bosom the sails of commerce and the barks of
pleasure. And there ran rippling by the side
of the road a little prattling infant streamlet,
bounding along its bright pebbly channel as in
haste to reach the calmer and more majestic expanse
of waters. On the right hand a dense and
dark plantation of firs skirted an abruptly rising
ground, at the end of which the road brought
the traveller by a sudden turn to an immediate
and full view of the massive and whitened towers
of Smatterton castle. The castle rose, as some
writers would say, but stood, we think, is the
most proper, majestically towering above all
surrounding objects, and enjoying from its lofty
turrets a view of four counties; what these
counties were we will not say,—we dislike personalities.</p>

<p>Now as Lord Spoonbill rode along under the
bright light of the moon, undisturbed by any
earthly sound but the tinkling of the sheep-bell,
or the barking of some cottage curs, he did seem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
to himself to enjoy the beauty of the scenery and
the pleasant balm of the autumnal air. And as a
feeling of scenic beauty penetrated his soul, there
entered also with that a thought of moral beauty,
and he felt that his mind did not harmonize with
the repose and beauty which surrounded him.
The feeling was not strong enough to be called
remorse, it was not serious enough to border upon
repentance. He felt conscious that he had acted
with meanness, that he had been guilty of a piece
of cruelty. He had used a most contemptible
and debasing artifice to produce alienation between
too worthy and excellent young persons,
loving and beloved, confiding and hoping amidst
their doubts and difficulties. These feelings
were unpleasant, and he endeavoured to soothe
himself by sophistry. After all, what injury had
he done to Robert Darnley? It would be a pity
that so fine a woman as Penelope Primrose should
be sacrificed to such a dull, plodding, common-place
man as the younger Darnley. Common-place
men are not worthy of the notice of men of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
fashion, nor deserving of the ordinary privileges
of humanity. His lordship had some recollection
of Mr Darnley as being a very poor creature, and
he thought that it was not probable that he
should have gained any great degree of improvement
by commercial pursuits and habits of business;
for, as everybody knows, these things
tend very much to degrade and to cramp the
mind; while on the other hand those pursuits
in which his lordship had been engaged had quite
the contrary effect. It must be very ennobling
to the mind to be engaged in gambling, horse-racing,
lounging, bird-shooting, fox-hunting, and
seduction; and any woman of sense and spirit
must infinitely prefer a protector of this description,
to a common-place man who knows nothing
of the world. As to Penelope then, his lordship
very naturally concluded that he was designing
her an essential service. Poor, simple, artless
creature, she knew nothing of society, all her
days had been passed in a sequestered village; and
as Robert Darnley was almost the only person<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
she was acquainted with, at all likely to make
her an offer, she fancied that she must of necessity
be in love with him. Lord Spoonbill had
not according to his own account been much of a
reader, but he had read the Sorrows of Werter,
and he had read many other compositions of
that nature; and he invariably found that the
lovers of the betrothed and the married were
men of genius, fine feeling, elegant manners, and
every species of sentimentality; and he observed
that they were induced to the very laudable practice
of seducing the affections of young women
from their husbands or lovers, by a mere principle
of compassion. It was a pity that so much
sense and sensibility should be so ill met, and
then how kind and considerate for some high-minded
young gentleman, like my Lord Spoonbill,
to save them from the stupidity of a common-place
husband, and consign them to infamy
and a broken heart. Nothing of course can be a
greater manifestation and proof of sensibility and
fine feeling, than seducing engaged affections,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
and, if Lord Spoonbill had written his own history,
we should have heard of as much sympathy
being expressed for him as there has been for
Werter and such like coxcombs; but as we do
not suffer his lordship to speak for himself, our
readers must be content to contemplate his character
in all the baldness of truth.</p>

<p>While thoughts as above described were occupying
the mind of his lordship, he drew nearer to
the domain of Smatterton, and as the view of the
castle and village opened upon him, he saw more
lights in the cottages than usual at that time in
the evening, and he heard at a little distance
sounds of more than ordinary movements. And
presently there came galloping towards him a servant
from the castle. Thinking that it was a
messenger sent for himself, he stopped the man
to ask what was the matter. The man drew up
his horse just for a moment, and in hurried accents
replied that Dr Greendale had been taken
seriously ill, and that the Earl had given orders
to ride over to M—— to fetch his lordship’s own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
physician. Waiting for no further interrogations
the messenger rode off as fast as before.</p>

<p>Will it be believed that at this moment one of
the first and promptest thoughts that occurred to
Lord Spoonbill was the idea, that should this illness
terminate fatally, the event might facilitate
his designs upon Penelope? Yet so it was. This
was his first and strongest feeling. He had forgotten
all the fatherly kindness of that good
man. He was insensible to any impression from
the numberless acts and words of friendship received
from the pious and holy rector. Dr Greendale
had been for many years an intimate friend
of the family at the castle. The Earl, though a
haughty man and of very strong aristocratic
feelings, had never regarded the worthy rector with
any other feeling than friendship and respect;
and the Countess, though not insensible to the
charms and fascinations of fashionable life, yet
delighted in the moral repose and the sober
beauties of the pastor’s character. The Earl and
Countess did not condescend to visit at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
rectory, but the doors of the castle were most
cheerfully open for the doctor, and there was
sincerity in their language, when the noble
inhabitants of the mansion declared that a more
welcome guest never crossed their threshold.
There must have been something good and pre-eminently
good in the character of a man who
could thus as it were command the moral homage
of minds in the highest walks of society. The
doctor was not a man of fortune or of family.
His respectability was altogether personal and
individual. This good man had taken very especial
notice of the heir of Smatterton, and had
endeavoured, according to the best of his ability,
to impress upon the mind of the young lord
those principles which, in after-life, might become
a blessing to him; and when he could not
but observe with all his natural disposition to
candor and charity, that there were bad principles
at work within, he endeavoured to hope
for the best, and in his pastoral admonitions to
the youth he did not assume the sternness of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
censor, but adopted the gentle insinuating language
of a friend to a friend. He was grieved,
indeed, when he saw that Lord Spoonbill was
likely to become a frivolous character, but he
was spared the bitter mortification of knowing
that he was decidedly profligate.</p>

<p>Miserably degraded must have been the mind
of Lord Spoonbill when intelligence of the good
man’s illness reached him, that he could think
only, or chiefly, of the vicious benefit likely to
accrue from the fatal termination of that illness.
There was indeed another thought in his lordship’s
mind. He could not but notice the
hurry in which the messenger seemed to be, and
he was also struck with the obvious sensation
which the illness of the rector had created in the
village. And this thought was more powerfully
impressed as he rode past a few cottages near
the park-gate. He there heard the comments
and commendations of the humblest of the
humble, and the poorest of the poor. He heard
the aged tremulously uttering their lamentations;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
these lamentations were perhaps rather selfish,
but still they were such as did honour to him
for whom they were expressed, if not to those
by whom they were used. Then his lordship
thought within himself of the power and efficacy
of moral worth; and he himself began to be
almost sorry; but his more degrading and vicious
thoughts had the ascendancy; and he was fully
resolved not to be moved or melted by the
sorrows of ignorant rustics.</p>

<p>He rode up to the castle, and having dismounted
he proceeded immediately to the magnificent
saloon, in which the Earl was so fond of
sitting even when alone. As Lord Spoonbill
entered the apartment, the Earl raised his eyes
from a book which he was reading, and said,
“You are soon returned, Spoonbill; did you
find Sir George’s company not very inviting? Or,
have you left Crop to enjoy the sole benefit of
the worthy baronet’s wit and humour?”</p>

<p>“I left the baronet taking his nap after dinner,
and desired Crop to stay and amuse him with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
his backgammon when he should wake. My
visits at Neverden, you know, are never long.”</p>

<p>The Earl was about to resume his book, when
Lord Spoonbill added, “But pray, sir, what is
this account I hear from one of your people about
Dr Greendale? I hope the old gentleman is not
seriously ill.”</p>

<p>By this interrogation the Earl seemed to be
roused to a recollection of what might otherwise
have passed away from his mind. Laying down
his book, he said:</p>

<p>“Oh!—ay—right: I am very sorry to tell
you that the poor man is very ill. That is, so I
understand—I sent immediately for my physician,
and I also said that, if it were necessary, I myself
would go down to the rectory and see the good
man. He will be a very great loss to the village.
The poor people are very much attached to him,
and I believe he is very conscientiously attentive
to his duties. We must do all we can for
him.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, we must. I am sure I should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
extremely sorry to lose him. What is the nature
of his complaint? I was at the rectory last night,
and he seemed perfectly well.”</p>

<p>“They tell me,” replied the Earl, “that it is
a fit of apoplexy, and that the poor man is in a
state of total insensibility. I would certainly go
down and see him, late as it is, if I thought it
would do him any good. I shall hear what my
physician says.”</p>

<p>“If you will give me leave, sir, I will walk
down to the rectory, and bring you word how the
doctor is. That will save you the necessity of
going out so late.”</p>

<p>“Very good, very good, do so, I am anxious
to hear some more particular account.”</p>

<p>Lord Spoonbill then departed for the rectory.
And, when having heard what was the nature of
the rector’s illness, he had reason to apprehend
that the hand of death was upon him, the young
lord was more deeply moved. He really did
make anxious haste to the parsonage. It is a
great pity that he did not pay more attention to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
these frequent admonitions which he received
as it were from his better genius, and by which
he was reminded that good principles were not
altogether foreign to his nature; but he resisted
them—he felt “a dread of shame among the
spirits beneath.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>


<p>When his lordship arrived at the rectory, he
found the door standing open, and the lower
apartments of the house deserted. While he
was hesitating whether he should seek his way
to the doctor’s apartment, one of the domestics
made her appearance, and his lordship very
earnestly inquired after the afflicted pastor.
With deep and unaffected feeling she replied,
that her dear master was very, very ill, and with
increased emotion continued—</p>

<p>“Oh, my lord, if you will see him, perhaps
he may know you—he may try to speak.”</p>

<p>“Certainly I will see him. How long is it
since he was taken?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>“Only two hours, my lord. He was quite
well this afternoon at five o’clock, and then he
went into his study, where he always goes about
that time, and we heard nothing of him till about
two hours since; his bell rang, and I went, your
lordship, to see what my master wanted, and
there I saw him sitting in his great chair quite
speechless.”</p>

<p>The poor woman was overcome with her own
emotion, and Lord Spoonbill hastened to the
room into which the patient had been removed.
When he entered the apartment, he saw by the
light of one dim candle, and a recently kindled
fire, the figure of Dr Greendale sitting in an
easy chair, in a state of apparent insensibility,
and on one side of him sat Mrs Greendale,
grasping his hand with convulsive eagerness, and
looking anxiously on his still and frozen features:
how like and how unlike what he was! On the
other side Penelope was kneeling, holding him
also by the hand, and hiding her face, that its
expression of deep feeling might not needlessly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
distress her aunt. Gentle sobbings were heard,
and the hard breathings of the death-stricken
man. His lordship stood for a few seconds as if
rivetted to the spot where his eye first caught the
sight of the melancholy group. Mrs Greendale
first noticed the presence of a stranger, and
recognised his lordship, who then advanced with
slow and gentle step towards the sick man, and
silently took the hand of Mrs Greendale, whose
tears then flowed afresh, as with louder sobbings
she exclaimed—</p>

<p>“Oh, my lord, what a sight is here! Those
dear eyes have been fixed as they are now for
hours. He was a good man, my lord; such a
heart! such tenderness! Oh, he cannot, he cannot
continue long! Oh, that I should live to
see this!”</p>

<p>As Mrs Greendale spoke, Penelope rose from
her kneeling posture, and turning round, then
first saw that Lord Spoonbill was in the room.
His lordship intreated Mrs Greendale to compose
herself, and then turning again towards the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
sick man’s chair, he held out his hand to Penelope,
who resigned to his lordship the hand
the dying man, which she had been holding.
Lord Spoonbill took the offered hand, and kneeling
on one knee pressed the hand to his lips,
and looked with searching earnestness to the face
of the patient, as if endeavouring to rouse him
into consciousness and recollection. The eyes
were fixed and motionless, and their brightness
was passing away. After a few moments there
appeared a convulsive movement of the lips, and
there seemed to be a gleam of consciousness in
the eye, and the hand which Lord Spoonbill had
been holding was lifted up and placed on his
lordship’s head, from whence it fell in a moment,
and the breathing, after one long sigh, died
away and was heard no more. At the instant
of the change, Mrs Greendale uttered a piercing
shriek, and fell senseless to the floor. Penelope,
as if unconscious of the distress of her aunt and
the presence of Lord Spoonbill, knelt gently
down, and lifting up her hands and her eyes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
murmured a prayer, which relieved for a moment
her bursting heart; for tears came copiously to
her aid, and her presence of mind was soon
restored, and she assisted the domestics in removing
Mrs Greendale into another apartment.</p>

<p>Lord Spoonbill then took his leave, and as he
quitted the house of mourning he felt as he had
never felt before. He had seen life in many of
its varieties, but death had been to his eye and
thoughts a stranger. He had now witnessed
such a scene as he never had before. His mind
was deeply and powerfully moved. But yesterday,
and he had seen Dr Greendale in the
fullness of strength and the vigour of health, and
life was bright about him, and he was in its
enjoyments and sympathies. One day, one little
day, produced an awful change. The music of
the tongue was mute, the benevolence of the look
had fled, the animation of the intellect had
vanished, and the beatings of the kind heart had
ceased. Then did the young lord call to mind
many kind expressions which the good man had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
used towards him. He thought of the day when
he went at the desire of the Earl his father,
rather than by any prompting of his own inclination,
to call at the rectory and take leave of the
doctor, previously to setting out on his journey
to Cambridge, when he first entered the University.
He recollected that on that occasion he
had been received in the doctor’s study, and the
good man carefully laid aside his books, and
drew his chair round and conversed with him
most cheerfully and most wisely; and he remembered
how very tenderly he hinted at the possibility
of juvenile follies, and how like a friend
and companion he endeavoured to guard his
mind against the fascinations of vice. He remembered
also the fervent prayer which the
good man uttered at parting, and the words
seemed to live again, and he heard afresh the
pious rector pray, “May God bless you, my dear
young friend, and keep you from the evil that is
in the world, and make you an ornament to that
station which you are destined to fill.” Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
came to his mind the sad neglect of all the kind
precepts which the holy man had given him, and
he felt that as yet the pastor’s prayer had not
been answered by the event. Now, had these
feelings been followed by that sobriety and
steadiness of thought which should be the natural
fruit of such emotions, it had been well for him;
but unfortunately he had so much satisfaction in
these emotions, and looked upon them as being
virtue, and not merely the means of virtue, so
that they failed to produce any lasting effect
upon his mind, or to cause any change in his
conduct. He was proud of his remorse and
pleased with his regrets, and so the virtue which
had its birth in a tear, evaporated when that tear
was dry.</p>

<p>Before Lord Spoonbill had left the rectory
many minutes, he met the medical gentleman on
his way to the house. He stopped the physician
and told him that all was over.</p>

<p>With due solemnity, and professional solemnity
is very solemn indeed, the medical attendant of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
the Earl of Smatterton shook his head and
replied—</p>

<p>“Indeed! Aye, I thought I should find it so,
from the account which the messenger gave me.
However, my lord, as I am thus far, I may as
well just look in. There is a possibility, perhaps,
that even yet the use of the lancet may not
be too late.”</p>

<p>Lord Spoonbill did not oppose the physician’s
wish, though he had no expectation of any benefit
to be derived from it. He therefore returned
and waited the report. The man of medicine
soon rejoined his lordship, and pronounced the
patient beyond the reach of professional skill.</p>

<p>“The spirit, my lord, has left the body,”
continued he, “according to the vulgar expression.”</p>

<p>No man could more heartily enjoy the reprobation
of vulgar phraseology than could Lord
Spoonbill, generally speaking; but at this moment
he was not disposed to be critical, and he
answered the medical man rather pettishly. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
was not for his own part able so quickly to make
the transition from the grave to the gay as persons
more accustomed to such scenes. It is also
not very uncommon for the imperfectly virtuous
to be exceedingly morose when under the impression
of serious or religious feelings. The
physician was very much surprised at the manner
in which his lordship received the above-quoted
speech; for it is a great absurdity in these
enlightened days to imagine that there is any
such thing as a soul. If there had been any
such thing, the medical gentlemen, who have
very minutely dissected the human body, certainly
must have found it. But as they have
not seen it, clearly it has no existence, and that
which we take for the soul is only a sort of a
kind of a something that is not a soul, but
is only a word of four letters. Many of the
Newmarket students indeed had discovered this
fact before the dissectors had revealed it.</p>

<p>When the medical philosopher observed that
Lord Spoonbill did not express any approbation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
of the phraseology whereby a doubt of the existence
of a soul was intimated, he did not consider
that the disapprobation might be more from feeling
than from opinion, and therefore he proceeded
to the discussion of the subject in a regular and
systematic method. His lordship was, however,
not at all disposed to listen to his arguments,
and the two walked side by side in silence to the
castle.</p>

<p>When the Earl saw his medical oracle, he
directed his inquiries first to him—</p>

<p>“Doctor, you will be seated,” having been
uttered with its usual majesty of condescension,
the Earl then proceeded to ask—</p>

<p>“And now, doctor, what report do you bring
of our worthy rector?”</p>

<p>“Dr Greendale, my lord, is no more. Life
was extinct before I could reach him; and I am
of opinion that nothing could have saved him.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! you don’t say so! It is a sad loss.
The doctor was a most excellent man. I had a
very high opinion of him. I gave him the living<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
purely for his moral worth. He had nothing else
to recommend him. I always make it an invariable
rule to distribute the church preferment
which is in my power, purely on the ground of
merit. I am never influenced by any political
feeling.”</p>

<p>“Your lordship,” replied the physician, who
understood his lordship’s mind as well as his
body, and perhaps better; “your lordship is
remarkable for the good judgment which you
always exercise in these matters, and indeed in
everything else where the public good is concerned.
It would be well for the country if the
distribution of public and responsible offices were
in such good hands. We should not hear so
much the language of dissatisfaction.”</p>

<p>“Doctor, you are disposed to compliment.
But it is not very easy to prevent the language
of dissatisfaction. It is too common and too
indiscriminate. It is not proper that the common
people should acquire a habit of carping at all
the acts of the government. The multitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
cannot understand these things. Now I have
studied the science of government with great and
close attention, and I think I do know something
which even the ministers themselves do not
rightly understand. They are engaged in the
dry details of office, and they have been brought
up in the trammels of prejudice. For my part I
have no prejudice. I do not take a detailed but
comprehensive and philosophical view of things.”</p>

<p>Much more to the same purpose did his lordship
condescend to utter in the hearing and for
the instruction of the medical philosopher. The
sum and substance of the harangue was to inculcate
that truly philosophical view of government
which recommends that the multitude should
leave the work of opposition to the old aristocracy
of the country, and only now and then, as
that aristocracy may dictate, present petitions to
parliament to countenance and support the measures
proposed by his majesty’s opposition. The
man of medicine was convinced of the truth and
justice of every sentiment which the Earl of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
Smatterton was pleased in the profundity of his
wisdom to advance: for though his lordship was
in opposition he did not like to be opposed: and
who does? His lordship then offered some refreshment
to his medical friend, and the subject
of the decease of the rector was renewed.</p>

<p>“I am very much afraid,” said his lordship,
“that the poor widow is not left in very comfortable
circumstances. But I will see that something
shall be done for her.”</p>

<p>After his lordship had received from the physician
his meed of praise for his liberality of intention
towards the destitute widow, he proceeded
to speak of his own good intentions:</p>

<p>“I am very sorry that I did not see poor Greendale
before his death. I had no idea he was in
such immediate danger. I certainly should have
gone down to the rectory in person, late as it
was, had I been aware that the good man was so
near his end. However, I did all I could; I sent
for the best advice that was to be had.”</p>

<p>This was a very considerate and proper speech.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
Thus did the Earl of Smatterton liberally repay
the compliments which he had received from his
medical friend and adviser. It should also be
remarked, that the expression which his lordship
has used more than once is rather a singularity.
He dwelt very much upon the lateness of
the hour. Now it was notorious, that in London
there was scarcely a single house where night
was turned into day and day into night so
entirely as in Lord Smatterton’s: but in the
country his lordship set a most excellent example
of early hours. For, as he very wisely
observed, agricultural pursuits require daylight;
the poor people in the country cannot bear the
expense of candles, and therefore it is highly
proper to set them the example of early hours.
This was certainly very considerate of his lordship;
and for this considerateness he was duly
praised by his physician. It is truly astonishing
that anybody should ever be censorious, for there
is much more to be got by praising than by
blaming one’s fellow-creatures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>The physician took a handsome fee and a polite
leave; and Colonel Crop just at that moment
entered the saloon, having finished his evening’s
entertainment at Neverden Hall. To him also
was communicated the intelligence of the sudden
decease of the worthy rector of Smatterton. And
as soon as he heard the information, he said:</p>

<p>“Poor man, I am sorry for him: has he left a
family?”</p>

<p>He had not left a family, or, if he had, Colonel
Crop would have been very sorry for them too.
The hour of rest was arrived, and more than
arrived. But Lord Spoonbill enjoyed not the
sweets of repose. His mind was torn by conflicting
thoughts, and harassed by bitter reflections
and self-reproaches. He thought of the
mean transaction of the morning and the solemn
scene of the evening. For awhile he had a
fancy that the principle of virtue was the ascendant
feeling of his soul, and he thought that he
would not pursue the scheme which he had commenced.
He looked at the letter which he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
intercepted, and had some faint notions that he
should cause it to reach its destination. At all
events, he would not be so mean as to open the
letter; that was an offence of which he had never
been guilty. He consigned the letter to the
flames. He thought of Dr Greendale, and he
was all virtue and penitence. He thought of
Penelope, and considered that it would be a pity
for so amiable, and intelligent, and affectionate
a creature to be sacrificed to such a dull, plodding,
commercial man as Robert Darnley. At
length, wearied by a multitude of thoughts, he
fell asleep. But ever and anon his rest was
broken by painful and frightful dreams. He was
grasping the hand of a lovely and interesting one,
and was using the language of passion and persuasion,
and he looked up to catch the smile of
beauty and the languishing look of love—and
there were before him the glassy eye, and the
quivering lip, and the ghastly looks of death. He
felt upon his head the hand of blessing, and then
there rung in his ears the horrid language of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
execration. He saw the mild and venerable form
of the pious friend of his early youth, and he
heard from his lips the sentiments of devotion
and the promises of hope; and then the face was
distorted by pain, and the voice was all the
harshness of reproach and the keenness of condemnation.
Gradually this agitation of the spirits
subsided, and the wearied frame sunk into
calmer rest; and when the day-light shone into
his apartment, and the morning sun awakened
the song of the birds, the darkness and gloom of
the night were forgotten, and the mind of the
young patrician recovered its wonted insensibility
and apathy to all that is good and generous. The
emotions of the past night were ridiculed, and
thus the character received an additional impetus
to that which is bad.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>


<p>On the following morning the news of Dr
Greendale’s sudden death reached the neighbouring
village of Neverden. Mr Darnley was deeply
concerned at the intelligence, and prepared to
pay an immediate visit to the afflicted widow to
offer such consolation and assistance as circumstances
might require. On his way from home
he went through Neverden park, and called at
the hall to acquaint his patron baronet of the
dismal intelligence just received. Sir George
met Mr Darnley at the door of the house, and
thus the rector was saved the trouble of alighting.
Another trouble was also saved him, namely, that
of communicating the news to the baronet: for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
as soon as the worshipful magistrate saw Mr
Darnley, he bawled out at the top of his voice:</p>

<p>“Good morning, Darnley, good morning. Bad
news from Smatterton; poor Greendale’s dead.
What will become of the poor widow and his
pretty niece? Very sudden indeed. I always
thought he would go off so. Will you alight?
I suppose you are going over to Smatterton. Do
you know who is to have the living? It is a
pretty good thing, I believe.”</p>

<p>This was a mode of address not at all in unison
with the feelings of Mr Darnley, though quite in
keeping with the character and habits of Sir
George Aimwell. Not that Sir George was by
any means destitute of feeling. It is very likely
he might have been as much concerned at the
loss, as others who might express themselves more
pathetically; but, as the proverbial expression has
it, it was his way. This expression is an apology
for anything, and for everything, and more especially
for all breaches of decorum and violations
of propriety. It is quite enough to say, “he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
means no harm, it is his way.” It was a way
however which Mr Darnley did not approve and
dared not rebuke; for he had so high a respect
for rank, as one of the glorious blessings of our
constitution, that he could never violate its sacredness
by making it the subject of reproof,
otherwise than by indirect and general hints.
Mr Darnley was a strict, but not a sturdy moralist.
To the questions of Sir George he returned
such answers as he was able to give, and,
bowing politely, was about to continue his ride,
when the baronet called out to him again:</p>

<p>“Well, but I am sorry for the doctor, poor
fellow. I was going to send him some game this
morning, though we had but a bad day’s sport
yesterday. I shall send you a brace or two of
birds, Darnley.”</p>

<p>Mr Darnley made his acknowledgments for
the baronet’s liberality, and pursued his journey,
meditating on the various subjects and thoughts
which such events as these usually excite in
such minds as his. When he arrived at Smatterton,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
at the very entrance of the village he saw
symptoms of a general calamity. The old men
were standing in little groups, and looking serious,
and talking with great earnestness on the
subject of their loss: and when they saw Mr
Darnley ride past they drew aside and made more
serious reverence than usual; and, while they
uncovered their silvery heads and bowed to the
clergyman, there was in their looks an expression
which seemed to ask for some more acknowledgment
of their homage than the return bend of the
head; they seemed to implore him to address
them. And, as he was a man of discernment and
observation, he stopt his horse and spoke to an
old, a very old man, who was leaning on a stick
which trembled under his pressure, and said:</p>

<p>“So, my good friend, I am concerned to hear
that you have lost your worthy rector.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, it is God’s will. I am sure I did
not think that I should live to see that day.
Please your reverence, it was but yesterday
morning that I was speaking to my children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
about putting me into the ground; and I told
them that I should die contented if I thought
that they would continue to attend to the good
doctor’s instructions. And I thought that I
should have that good man to read at my grave.
Ah! sir, these are mysteries in providence; here
am I spared year after year merely to cumber the
ground, while our dear rector is cut off in the
midst of his days and usefulness.”</p>

<p>“You are rather advanced in years, I believe;
I have not seen you for some time. Have you
been unwell?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I am nearly ninety, and at my
time of life I cannot expect anything else than
illness and infirmity. I have not been out of my
doors for many months, but I could not help
hobbling out a little way just to hear some particulars
about our worthy rector. Alack, sir, I
had need give him a good word. He was my
best friend, so kind——”</p>

<p>The old man wept audibly; and Mr Darnley,
who had been affected by the very aspect of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
village as he entered it, felt himself unable to
make any reply, and rode on. When he reached
the rectory, and enquired for Mrs Greendale, the
domestic announced that her mistress was too ill
to be seen, but that Miss Primrose would make
her appearance immediately. Happy was it for
Penelope that there was on the present occasion
a division of interests and an opposing set of
feelings. Her troubles had come thickly upon
her; but the very meeting together of these
sorrows tended to soften them, or, what was
equivalent to that, to excite and compel her to
an unusual exertion of moral fortitude; and the
very circumstance of Mrs Greendale’s acute and
severe feeling was also the means of exciting and
rousing Penelope.</p>

<p>When therefore she met Mr Darnley, it was
with great composure and steadiness of countenance,
and she was able to narrate, with consistency
and intelligibility, the particulars of her
uncle’s decease. She mentioned the visit of Lord
Spoonbill, and spoke very highly of the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
propriety of his behaviour and the manifestation
which he gave of good feeling. Mr Darnley was
pleased to hear so good an account, and hoped
that so solemn and impressive a scene might be
instrumental in producing some good effect on
the young lord’s conduct. As Penelope was
always regarded by the family at Neverden as
possessing a steadiness of judgment beyond her
years, Mr Darnley, after the ordinary talk on
such occasions, ventured to extend his inquiries
as to the probable disposition of the widow and
Penelope after they should leave the rectory,
which must of course be resigned to the doctor’s
successor.</p>

<p>The young lady professed herself quite at a
loss to know what arrangements might be contemplated
by Mrs Greendale; but as to herself
she expressed her determination to take, as soon
as possible, a situation as governess in a private
family, and said that she was sure that the Countess
of Smatterton would give every assistance in
her power.</p>

<p>Mr Darnley expressed himself somewhat astonished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
at this decision, under what he called present
circumstances. Now here it may be proper
and necessary to explain. We have narrated, or
at least very strongly intimated, that there subsisted
between the niece of the late Dr Greendale
and the only son of Mr Darnley an engagement,
sanctioned by the parents of the latter. We
have also said, that Lord Spoonbill had cast the
eyes of affection on Penelope Primrose, and that
in order to wean her affections from him to whom
she was engaged, he had intercepted more than
once letters sent from Mr Robert Darnley to her.
We have stated also, that the apparent cessation
of the correspondence on the part of the young
gentleman had disturbed and distressed the mind
of Penelope. Her spirit, however, was above
naming or hinting the matter to the parents of
her absent friend. We have also informed our
readers that, only on the very day of Dr Greendale’s
decease, a letter had been intercepted and
destroyed by Lord Spoonbill, and that a letter
had reached the rectory of Neverden from the
young gentleman. In this letter Mr Robert Darnley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
had apprised his parents and sisters that they
might expect him in England in about six weeks
after the arrival of that communication: he had
also informed them that he had written to Penelope
by the same conveyance, informing her of
the same fact. He had also, in one part of that
letter which he had sent to Neverden, addressed
a line or two to his sister Ann, requesting her to
observe if there were in Penelope Primrose any
symptoms of alienated affection, or any manifest
partiality to any other person. This last enquiry
was thought merely the effect of that fanciful
jealousy which is, in some peculiarly-constructed
minds, the effect and concomitant of love: and
the general impression at the rectory of Neverden
was, that Robert Darnley would be in England in
six weeks, and that, as soon as conveniently it
could be arranged after his return, he would be
married to Penelope. It was therefore with no
small share of astonishment that Mr Darnley
heard the young lady make such a declaration as
that above recorded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>“But, my young friend, why have recourse to
such a step as that? It would be much better
that you should take up your abode with us at
Neverden. Indeed, I must almost insist upon it,
if you will not otherwise be induced to comply.
Under any other circumstances I should not
perhaps recommend such a step, but now that
you are so situated that you must soon leave
Smatterton, I think you cannot with propriety
do otherwise.”</p>

<p>To this language of Mr Darnley Penelope only
replied with great composure, indeed almost with
apathy: “I must beg, sir, that you will not press
that subject. You will, no doubt, be ultimately
convinced that I am acting more properly in submitting
myself to the direction and advice of
Lady Smatterton.”</p>

<p>At this speech of the young lady there came
into the mind of Mr Darnley a suspicion that the
jealousy expressed in his son’s letter was not
altogether unfounded. Not that he could have
supposed that Penelope Primrose should deliberately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
prefer a lover like Lord Spoonbill to a
young man of sense and good conduct like Mr
Robert Darnley; but he was well aware of the
fascinations of rank and the allurements of
fashionable splendour, and he also knew that it
was very possible for worthless and ignorant men,
by means of the mockery and mummery of conventional
politeness, to render themselves not
only not disagreeable, but absolutely engaging
and interesting to the young and unpractised.
He recollected the very handsome manner in
which Penelope had spoken of Lord Spoonbill,
and he also bethought himself of the unusual
event of the heir of Smatterton honoring the
party of Mrs Greendale with his company. Then
there came to his remembrance that, during the
whole, or nearly the whole evening, Penelope
was engaged at the pianoforte, and that she
joined Lord Spoonbill in several duets: and there
was also a recollection that his lordship, as soon
as he entered the room at the rectory, took a seat
on a sofa by the side of Miss Primrose, and directed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
his conversation for awhile almost exclusively
to her. Mr Darnley, having compared all
these circumstances, began to wonder at himself
that he should ever have been so dull as not to
observe that the affections of Penelope Primrose
belonged more to Lord Spoonbill than to
Robert Darnley.</p>

<p>Having made this discovery, and having silently
reproached himself for his stupidity that he had
not made it before, he did not hint the least word
of his suspicion to Miss Primrose; but simply
abstained from farther urging the matter about
her residence at Neverden. Mr Darnley was too
proud a man to stoop to any expostulations or
reproofs, or to show anything like resentment
upon the occasion. For he did not consider that
Penelope had inflicted an injury on his family,
but had merely declined a proffered honor.</p>

<p>He continued therefore his conversation upon
other topics connected with the doctor’s decease,
and, leaving a message of sympathy for Mrs
Greendale, politely, rather more politely than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
usual, took his leave of Penelope. She observed
indeed a change in his manner, but ascribed it to
the unusually serious impression produced on his
mind by the loss of a friend and acquaintance.</p>

<p>From the rectory Mr Darnley proceeded to
the castle, to make a call of homage on the Earl
of Smatterton. His lordship received the homage
graciously, and said, as was usual with him on
all such occasions, “Mr Darnley, I beg you
will be seated.”</p>

<p>Mr Darnley accordingly took a seat, and Lord
Smatterton accordingly began to speak forth his
own praises of his own most mighty condescension
and benevolence.</p>

<p>“You have been at the rectory this morning,
Mr Darnley? It was very proper and suitable
that your’s should be the first visit to the house
of mourning. You found the poor woman well,
I hope; that is, as well as may be under present
circumstances?”</p>

<p>Mr Darnley informed his lordship of the particulars
of his visit to the rectory, not forgetting to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
mention his own offer to give an asylum to the
doctor’s niece.</p>

<p>“Mr Darnley,” replied his lordship, “I very
much approve of your liberality. I can assure
you that I shall take care that neither the widow
nor the niece shall be destitute. I have always
entertained a very high opinion of Dr Greendale.
He was truly an excellent man. As soon as I
heard of his illness I sent for my own physician
to attend him, and had it not been so very late in
the evening I should have gone down to see him
myself. And indeed, notwithstanding it was so
late, I certainly should have gone had I been
aware of the danger in which he was. However
I did everything in my power, and I shall also
have an eye to the well-being of those who are
by his death left destitute; for I think I have
understood that the doctor had no property of
any consideration independently of his living.
But pray, Mr Darnley, what think you of the
propriety of giving to the world a volume or two
of the doctor’s sermons? They contain much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
good sense and sound doctrine. They are not
indeed so sublime as Irving’s, or so beautiful as
Alison’s, nor was it necessary that they should be;
for the common people cannot understand the
sublime and beautiful. What think you, I say,
Mr Darnley, of the propriety and eligibility of
publishing some of Dr Greendale’s sermons?”</p>

<p>“With all due deference to your lordship’s
superior judgment in such matters, I am humbly
of opinion,” replied Mr Darnley, “that good
sense and sound doctrine are no great recommendation
of sermons, at least they do not ensure
popularity so effectually as sublimity and beauty.
But I believe, my lord, that Dr Greendale was
engaged on a very important controversial work.
Now I have heard that controversial theology
has a much better sale than practical divinity,
and that sermons hardly ever go off, unless there
be some peculiar interest attached to the person
who wrote them, or to the circumstances under
which they were preached. If, therefore, your
lordship is disposed to assist in the publication<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
of any of the late doctor’s writings, I should
humbly apprehend that his great controversial
treatise would be most profitable to his widow,
and bring more fame to his memory.”</p>

<p>“That may be very true, Mr Darnley, but I do
not like controversy; it unsettles people’s minds.
I never knew any good come of it. But while
there are sectarians there must, to be sure, be
refutations of their errors, and the best way to
oppose sectarianism is by means of argument;
for I am a decided advocate for religious liberty,
only I do not like to have the minds of the common
people disturbed and unsettled. These
matters, Mr Darnley, I shall leave to you as a
friend of the late doctor; and if you are disposed
to publish any of his writings, they cannot come
out under better auspices. At all events I shall
subscribe for a certain number of copies.”</p>

<p>“Your lordship is very generous; and I hope
you will not find in the writings of the worthy
rector anything that shall tend to unsettle the
minds of the people, but rather the reverse. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
I understand that the object of the treatise
which I have mentioned to your lordship, is to
put an end to controversy. I recollect hearing
my worthy friend say, that he had answered and
refuted every objection that had ever been urged
against the established church, and that there
was not a single sect which he had not opposed
and confuted.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, if the work is of such a comprehensive
nature, I think it important that it should
be published. It is a great pity, however, that it
did not make its appearance during the doctor’s
life-time, it might have procured him a bishopric;
but really, Mr Darnley, I don’t know how it is, but
I have observed that ministers are not sufficiently
attentive to men of merit. They give away their
preferment merely for the purpose of parliamentary
influence. Now, for my part, I never do anything
of the kind—I always patronize merit. I gave the
living of Smatterton to Dr Greendale, purely on
account of his merit. I wish that this consideration
weighed more than it does with those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
whose patronage is more extensive and important
than mine.”</p>

<p>Mr Darnley had a better opinion of his majesty’s
ministers than the Earl of Smatterton had
expressed, and therefore he did not very readily
echo the last speech which his lordship made.
He took however especial care not to say anything
that might impeach his lordship’s judgment
and sagacity. The peer and the clergyman
parted on very good terms. The first was
delighted that he had enjoyed an opportunity of
speaking in laudatory terms of his own benevolence
and wisdom; and the last was very well
satisfied that while he had paid due reverence to
rank, he had not compromised his loyalty to his
majesty’s ministers, by complimenting at their
expense a member of his majesty’s opposition.</p>

<p>The day for Dr Greendale’s funeral arrived. It
was Sunday. This arrangement was made in
order to give opportunity for the poor and the
labouring classes to attend, and pay their last
tribute of respect to their benefactor and friend.
It was a very fine day, such as often happens in
the middle of September; and the day seemed
like a holiday. For, such is the nature of the
human mind that the attending on any ceremony
seems more a matter of amusement than of
sorrow. Joy, it appears, cannot be solitary, and
sorrow can hardly be social. When a multitude
assembles, be the purpose what it may for which
the assembling takes place, it wears generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
the aspect of amusement or pleasure. This is
particularly the case at funerals, and much more
so in other countries than our own.</p>

<p>The village of Smatterton was unusually full.
Many came from a distance, some to visit their
friends, some for a little extraordinary amusement
for the Sunday, and some probably with
a desire to pay a tribute of respect to the late
rector; for the name of Dr Greendale was celebrated
beyond the narrow limits of his own
parish. There were visitors at almost every
house in the village, and the little public-houses,
which on Sunday were ordinarily closed, now
were indulged with the privilege of being open,
Indeed the indulgence was absolutely necessary.
The funeral procession was very long, and many
of the mourners were mourners indeed. They
had a great regard for the late doctor, not for any
very profuse generosity which he had exhibited,
for that was not in his power; not for any unbounded
hospitality, for in that respect he was
limited in his circumstances, and confined as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
his time; not because he was a very eloquent and
entertaining preacher, for his sermons were plainness
itself; not because he was a sturdy politician,
either demagogue or sycophant, for it was
absolutely impossible for any one to conjecture
with plausibility to which party he belonged;
not because he indulged and flattered the vices
of either the great or the little, for he was not
unsparing in his rebukes of wickedness whenever
he met with it; but they loved and respected
him for the steadiness and respectability of his
character, for the integrity, purity, simplicity,
and sincerity of his life. Therefore they mourned
at his grave, and wept tears of real sorrow at the
loss of him.</p>

<p>The very persons who paid tithes were sorry
that he was departed from them, for they did not
think it likely that any other could be put in his
place to whom they would more cheerfully make
such payments. The funeral service was impressively
read by Mr Darnley, and in the afternoon
the same gentleman took the duty at the church,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
in order to deliver a funeral sermon for his late
friend and neighbour.</p>

<p>While the rites of sepulture were being performed
at the church, the daughters of Mr
Darnley were, by their presence and kind sympathy,
endeavouring to console the sorrowing
widow, and the doubly orphaned niece, at the
rectory house. Miss Darnley had heard at the
beginning of the week from her father the suspicion
which he entertained of the unsteadiness of
Penelope’s affections; and though the present
was not a proper time to make any direct
enquiries, or to use any obvious diligence to
discover the secret, yet she could not help
showing her attention a little alive to aught
which might seem to promise any clue for the
discovery of the young lady’s state of mind to
her brother. And as Mr Darnley had given a
hint that Penelope Primrose seemed to regard
Lord Spoonbill with very great approbation, and
to throw herself entirely on the patronage of the
Countess, Miss Darnley endeavoured to let a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
word or two fall which might either corroborate
or remove the suspicions which had been entertained
on that head.</p>

<p>It was very easy to direct the conversation to
their noble friends at the castle. Mrs Greendale
and Penelope both expressed great gratitude for
the kind sympathy which they had experienced
from the earl and countess. Penelope also
praised the very humane and feeling conduct
of Lord Spoonbill; but the language which she
used, and the manner in which she spoke of his
lordship, gave no light upon the subject of
suspicion. It was not indeed probable that the
son of so proud a nobleman as the Earl of Smatterton
should think of allying himself by marriage
with the niece of a clergyman, portionless
and unconnected. Nor indeed was it likely that
a young woman of such excellent understanding
as Miss Primrose should be weak enough to
imagine an attachment where none existed.
Suffice it to say, that notwithstanding all the
pains which Miss Darnley used for the purpose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
she could not ascertain whether or not there
existed such an attachment. Her conclusion
rather inclined to the opinion that her brother’s
suspicions were but a little emanation of constitutional
jealousy.</p>

<p>We have said that Mr Darnley was engaged to
perform the service of the church in the afternoon.
On this occasion the multitude assembled
was very great. The church was crowded
to suffocation, and besides the great mass of
people within, there were also many without;
many young persons who loved rather to idle
about the churchyard than to take pains to press
their way in. They loitered about in groups,
and they amused themselves with reading the
monumental inscriptions, and some perhaps were
then and there reminded of pious and amiable
parents, of intimate friends and companions.
They did not loiter altogether unprofitably, if
feelings of a kind and tender nature were
excited in their breasts by recollections of the
departed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>But there was one who seemed to have no
companion there, or friend among the living or
the dead. There was a young female in deep
mourning, walking sorrowfully up and down the
broad gravel-walk which led from the road to the
church-door. She looked not at those that
passed her, and she did not seem to regard the
monumental inscriptions with any interest. Her
form was graceful, but her figure was small.
There was a paleness on her cheeks which looked
like the paleness of sorrow and privation; but
amidst that paleness might be discerned much
beauty. There had been brightness in those
eyes, and dimples on those cheeks, and wreathed
smiles upon those lips; but these were now
departed, and instead thereof was the</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Leaden look that loves the ground.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">She seemed to be heedless of all that was
around her. The young beaux and coquettes of
the village attracted not her attention, and all
the change of look that was seen was an occasional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
and earnest direction of her eyes towards
the door of the church when any footsteps were
heard near it. There were no tears in the eyes,
but there was an expression of countenance,
which told that tears had been, and there was
a stillness of sorrow which intimated that tears
had done their utmost, and could no longer
relieve.</p>

<p>The young are ever prone to pity, and they
most deeply and feelingly commiserate such
as seem to be least importunate for sympathy;
for despair is the sublimity of grief, and its
very unobtrusiveness rivets the attention. An
image of sorrow like this is not easily shaken
from the mind. We may pass by it, and seem
not to heed it; but it comes upon us again in
our recollections; and our thoughts revert to
it without effort, or even against effort. Thus
did this vision fascinate and enchain the minds
of those who in the indolence of their sabbath
holiday were strolling about the churchyard.
By degrees their idle talk was suspended or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
subdued. Their own little interests were forgotten,
and they one and all wondered who it
could be. And they were saying one to another,
“How beautiful she looks!”—“How very pale
she is!”—“She looks as if she were very ill.”
Many such remarks were made, but they were
uttered in a low tone, and with an endeavour not
to appear to take particular notice of the melancholy
stranger.</p>

<p>At length the service in the church was over,
and the multitude was pouring out. Then the
beautiful mourner took her station at the porch,
and watched with earnestness every face that
passed by; and over her pale countenance there
came a hectic flush, as the numbers increased
and as the expected one seemed to be nearer.
The numbers diminished and the paleness returned.</p>

<p>A sound of carriage-wheels was heard at a
little distance, and the stranger, moving from the
porch at which she had stationed herself, saw in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
another direction a narrow path, leading from a
different door, and on that path were walking
three persons, who, before she could reach them,
were seated in the carriage and had vanished
from her sight.</p>

<p>To explain these appearances as far as it is
at present necessary, we must turn our attention
awhile from the newly-introduced fair one, and
accompany the Earl and Countess, with their
hopeful son, back again to the castle.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the Earl alighted from the
carriage when he was informed that, during his
absence, a young person in deep mourning had
been at the castle nearly an hour ago, and had
been very importunate for an audience with his
lordship. To the very natural enquiries of name,
description, and business, the only answer which
could be given was, that the stranger refused to
state her name or business, and that her appearance
was that of a very respectable and rather
pretty young woman; and that though she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
expressed great anxiety to see his lordship, yet
there was nothing in her manner obtrusive or
troublesome.</p>

<p>While this information was being conveyed to
the Earl, the Countess had passed on to her own
apartment; but Lord Spoonbill attended to what
was said, and that with no small share of interest.
His recollection and conscience interpreted
the mystery, and his ingenuity was now
taxed to evade an exposure, which he dreaded.
Assuming an air of indifference, he said:</p>

<p>“Perhaps, sir, it may be a daughter of one of
your Yorkshire tenants. She is described as
being in mourning, and if I recollect rightly, we
heard of the death of one of them very lately. It
is however very unsuitable to come here on a
Sunday on matters of business. I am about to
walk down into the village, and if I can meet
with the young person I will save you the trouble
of attending to her.”</p>

<p>“Do so, Spoonbill, do so: I do not approve of
being interrupted on a Sunday; it is a bad example<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
to the people in the country: it does not
so much signify in London.”</p>

<p>It was fortunate, or, more properly speaking
unfortunate, for the young lord that the Earl his
father was very easy to be imposed upon; and
perhaps the more so from the very high opinion
which he entertained of his own wisdom and
sagacity. But such was his confidence in the
good conduct and good disposition of his son,
that he would not easily have been brought to
give credence to any story of a disgraceful nature
told against him. The young man took advantage
of this, and so he always passed for a very
prudent and steady person: and it was not unfrequent
that the Earl himself would commend the
steadiness and sobriety of his son, and propose
him as an example to those who were companions
of his irregularities.</p>

<p>After the conversation above recorded, the
young lord made the best of his way through the
park towards that gate which led into the village;
carefully at the same time observing that his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
victim did not escape him and return by another
path to the castle.</p>

<p>He met her not in the park; and when he
arrived at the gate he was at a loss which way to
turn. It would have been a miserable exposure
of his conduct had the stranger found her way
back to the castle and obtained an interview with
the Earl. Still worse in the mind of Lord Spoonbill
would it have been that the Countess should
become acquainted with that part of his character
and conduct which might be communicated to
her by the mysterious stranger; for, with all his
irregularity of demeanour, and amidst conduct
which manifested a most serious want of good
feeling and good principle, he felt a regard for
his mother, and an anxiety for her comfort and
composure of mind: he disguised himself to his
father from fear, and to his mother from love.</p>

<p>Agitated by distracting thoughts, he stood at
the park gate, gazing alternately in different
directions; and by the intensity of his feelings
was at last rivetted in an almost unconscious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
state of mind to the spot on which he was standing.
Suddenly his pulse beat quicker, and his
heart seemed to swell within him, when at a little
distance he saw the dreaded one approaching
him. Had he seen her anywhere else his first
impulse would have been to avoid her; but here
his truest and best policy was to submit to an
interview, however painful. Shall he meet her
with kindness?—shall he meet her with reproaches?—shall
he meet her with coldness?
These were enquiries rapidly passing through his
mind as she drew nearer and nearer. It was
difficult for him to decide between cruelty and
hypocrisy: but the last was most natural to him,
so far as custom is a second nature.</p>

<p>The afflicted one moved slowly with her eyes
fixed on the ground, and she saw not her enemy
till so near to him, that on lifting up her face and
recognizing his well-known features, the sudden
shock produced a slight hysteric shriek.</p>

<p>Lord Spoonbill was not so lost to all feeling of
humanity as to be insensible to the anguish of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
mind which she now suffered, who had once
regarded him as a friend, and had loved him,
“not wisely, but too well.” He held out his
hand to her with an unpremeditated look of kindness
and affection; and which, being unpremeditated,
bore the aspect of sincerity. The stranger
at first hesitated, and seemed not disposed to
accept the offered hand; but she looked up in
his face, and the blood mounted to her cheeks
and the tears stood in her eyes, and she gave
him her hand, and covered her face and wept
bitterly.</p>

<p>There are moments in which shameless profligates
look foolish and feel that they are contemptible.
This was such a moment to Lord
Spoonbill. He was moved, and he was mortified
that he was moved; and there was a general
feeling of confusion and perplexity in his mind.
What could he say? or how could he act? He
began to stammer out something like gentleness,
and something like reproof. But she who stood
before him was as an accusing spirit, to whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
apology was mockery, and repentance too late.
At length, when the first emotion began to abate,
he said:</p>

<p>“Ellen, what brings you here? Surely this is
not a proper day for a visit like this. What
could induce you too to endeavour to see the
Earl? If you once mention the affair to him you
are irretrievably ruined; I can do nothing for
you.”</p>

<p>A reproachful look, a deep sigh, and the withdrawing
her hand from his, were the only answer
which the above speech received. She attempted
to speak, but words were wanting; and after a
little more appearance of confusion on the part of
his lordship, he seemed for the first time to notice
her mourning dress, and with real tenderness of
manner asked her what peculiar loss or misfortune
had brought her to Smatterton. Assuming
then a steadiness of tone and greater composure
of manner, she at last spoke out:</p>

<p>“My lord, it is indeed a deep affliction which
has brought me to appeal to your pity. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
took me from a widowed mother; you deserted me
with promises unfulfilled. I returned to that dwelling
which was destined to be my home no more.
I have closed my mother’s eyes, which did indeed
look a forgiveness which she could not speak. I
am now an outcast, unless I can find the means
of reaching a distant relative, who will give me a
home. I have made frequent application by
letter to your lordship and to the Earl, and I was
fearful that my letters had not reached you; and
I had no resource but to come here to speak for
myself.”</p>

<p>Lord Spoonbill had received these letters; not
only those addressed to himself, but those designed
for his father. He had paid but little attention
to them; for the name of Ellen Fitzpatrick had
ceased to be interesting to him. He had in
former days made small pecuniary remittances;
but had latterly declined them. But now seeing
before him one whom he had deeply injured, and
beholding her as a suppliant in the most humble
attitude, and hearing that it was possible that an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
arrangement might be made, whereby he should
no longer be troubled with her visits or letters,
he felt his mind greatly relieved, and he was disposed
to be generous. He therefore promptly
supplied her with the means of reaching her
friend, and enjoined, with no little earnestness,
that she should leave Smatterton immediately,
and that without even returning again to the
village.</p>

<p>What account the hopeful hereditary legislator
gave to the Earl we shall not state; suffice it to
say, that he told his own story, that the Earl
believed it, that it answered the purpose for
which it was invented. And it came to pass
that, on the day following, when there was mention
made of the young person in deep mourning
who was seen in the churchyard on Sunday, it
was confidently stated, and easily believed, that
it was a young lady out of her mind who had
escaped from her keepers.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>


<p>We have spoken favorably of the Countess.
She was for the most part a considerate as well
as a benevolent woman: we say for the most
part, because we must make some slight exception.
And if our readers be angry with us for
not indulging them with perfect characters, we
can only say we are sorry for it, and will
promise that as soon as we meet with a faultless
character we will give the history thereof to the
world. In the meantime we must take what we
find, and make the best of it. The Countess of
Smatterton then was, as we have said, possessed
of many good qualities, but was not perfect.
There was occasionally a want of considerateness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
in her very benevolence; and most people indeed,
who do any good at all to their fellow-creatures,
prefer doing it in their own way. There is perhaps
some benefit in this; for otherwise the
opulent and powerful would be too much importuned,
and the number of the dependent be most
awfully increased. To proceed then: we have
observed that the Countess was not uniformly
considerate. She could, and for the most part
did, bestow her favors with great grace and
urbanity of manner; but occasionally she was
rather forgetful of the proprieties; she did not
always consider that what might be suitable in
one person or station might not be suitable in
another. This feeling was manifested in the
interview with which her grace was pleased to
honor Miss Primrose, soon after the decease of
her valuable friend and relative, Dr Greendale.</p>

<p>The Countess very kindly invited the ladies to
the castle. Her ladyship received the widow and
her niece in her own apartment. No one knew
so well as the Countess how to manage the language<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
and address of consolation. Mrs Greendale
was charmed with the delicate and feeling
manner in which she was received; and her
ladyship was happy that any attention of hers
could gratify and soothe the afflicted.</p>

<p>With an exquisite dexterity of address the
Countess contrived to introduce an allusion to
the situation of Penelope Primrose; and as
neither the young lady nor her aunt was in full
possession of the circumstances in which Mr
Primrose was at that time, they both had the
impression on their minds that there was no
other immediate prospect for his daughter than
the exertion of her own talents and acquirements
to provide her with the means of support. The
worthy rector had not as yet been long enough
in the grave to give Penelope an opportunity of
feeling the difference of Mrs Greendale’s manner
towards her; but she had penetration enough to
foresee what must be her situation so long as she
remained under the same roof as her aunt. With
the utmost readiness did she therefore listen to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
the Countess, when speaking of the various employments
to which a young person situated as
she was might turn her attention.</p>

<p>“Lord Smatterton,” said the Countess, “has
frequently mentioned the subject to me, and he
recommends a situation in a private family. There
are certainly some advantages and some disadvantages
in such a situation: very much depends
upon the temper and disposition of almost every
individual in the family. It is possible that you
may meet with a family consisting of reasonable
beings, but it is more than probable that you
may have to encounter arrogance or ignorance;
these are not excluded from any rank.”</p>

<p>This language seemed to Penelope as an intimation
that a school would be a more desirable
sphere in which to make profitable use of her
acquisitions. It was not for her to oppose any
objections to the implied recommendations of so
good and so great a friend as her ladyship; but
she felt considerable reluctance to that kind of
employment, which she fancied had been suggested.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
Her reply was embarrassed but respectful,
intimating that she was ready to adopt any
mode of employment which the Countess might
be pleased to suggest. Her ladyship gave a
smile of approbation to the acquiescent disposition
which the young lady manifested, and added:</p>

<p>“If Miss Primrose could conquer a little feeling
of timidity, which might naturally enough be
experienced by one so retired in her habits, it
would be possible for her, with her great vocal
powers and musical talent, not only to find means
of maintenance, but to arrive at a competent independence,
by adopting the musical profession.
Then she would also enjoy the pleasure of good
society. If such arrangement be agreeable, I will
most willingly charge myself with providing the
preparatory instruction under a distinguished
professor. What does my young friend think of
such occupation?”</p>

<p>Had sincerity been the readiest road to the
patronage and friendship of the great, this question
might have been very readily and easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
answered. But Penelope knew better than to
suppose that any advantage could arise from a
direct opposition to the wishes of a patron.
Repugnant as she was to the proposal, she dared
not to whisper the least syllable of contradiction,
on the ground of dislike, to the profession; but
after a blush of mortification, which the Countess
mistook for a symptom of diffidence, she replied:</p>

<p>“I fear that your ladyship is disposed to estimate
rather too highly the humble talents I may
possess, and that I shall not answer the expectations
which so distinguished patronage might
raise.”</p>

<p>The Countess was not altogether pleased with
this shadow of an objection; for it seemed to call
in question her own discernment. She therefore
replied with some quickness:</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Miss Primrose: I have
usually been considered as something of a judge
in these matters; and, if I do not greatly mistake,
you are peculiarly qualified for the profession;
and, if you would condescend to adopt my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
recommendation, I will be answerable for its
success.”</p>

<p>The Countess, with all her kindness and considerateness,
had not the slightest idea that there
could be in a young person, situated as Penelope,
any feeling of pride or thought of degradation.
But pride was in being before titles were invented;
and even republics, which, in the arrogance of
equality, may repel from their political vocabulary
all distinctions of fellow citizens, cannot
eradicate pride from the human heart. In a
civilized country there is not perhaps an individual
to be found who is incapable of the sensation
of degradation. Miss Primrose thought it
degrading to become a public singer; she felt
that it would be publishing to the world that
she was not independent. The world cares little
about such matters. Right or wrong, however,
this feeling took possession of the young lady’s
mind; and as pride does not enter the mind by
means of reasoning, it will not be expelled by
any process of ratiocination. For all this, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
the worthy Countess could make no allowance;
and it appeared to her that if a young person
were under the necessity of serving her
superiors in rank for the sake of maintenance,
it signified very little what mode of servitude
were applied to.</p>

<p>There was also another consideration which
weighed not a little with the Countess, in almost
insisting upon Miss Primrose’s adopting the
musical profession. Her ladyship was a distinguished
patroness, and a most excellent judge
of musical talent; and there was a rival patroness
who had never yet been able to produce,
under her auspices, anything at all equal to
Penelope Primrose. The mortification or defeat
of a rival is a matter of great moment to minds of
every description. Whenever there is the weakness
of rivalry there must be of necessity also the
vanity of triumph, and to that occasionally much
will be sacrificed.</p>

<p>Mrs Greendale, who was present at this discussion,
sided most cordially with the Countess;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
but had the proposal come from any other
quarter, in all human probability it would have
been resented as an indignity. Penelope was
also well aware that it was absolutely necessary
that she should leave the asylum in which
so many of her few days had been spent, and
she therefore, with as good a grace as her
feelings permitted, gave assent to the proposal
which the Countess had made. And thereby her
generous patroness was softened.</p>

<p>The discussion of this question occupied no
inconsiderable portion of time, though we have
not thought it necessary to repeat at length the
very common-place dialogue which passed on the
subject. Our readers must have very languid
imaginations if they cannot supply the omission
for themselves. Suffice it to say, that the arguments
used by the Countess of Smatterton were
much stronger than the objections which arose
in the mind of Penelope Primrose; and the consideration
of these arguments, backed by the
reflection that she had no other immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
available resource, determined the dependent one
to acquiesce in that which her soul abhorred.
It was all very true, as the amiable Countess
observed, that an occupation which introduced
the person so employed to the notice and into
the saloons of the nobility, could not be essentially
degrading; it was also very true that there
could be no moral objection to a profession
which had been ornamented by some of the
purest and most virtuous characters. All this
was very true; but notwithstanding this and
much more than this which was urged by the
Countess, still Penelope did not like it. There
is no accounting for tastes.</p>

<p>Some young ladies there are who think that, if
they should be situated as Penelope was, they
would not suffer any inducement to lead them to
a compliance with such a proposal. They imagine
that no earthly consideration whatever
should compel them to that which they abhorred
or disapproved. They cannot think that Penelope
deserved the title of heroine, if she could thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
easily surrender her judgment and bend her will
to the dictation of a patroness. But let these
young ladies be informed, that in this compliance
lay no small portion of the heroism of
Penelope’s character. She gained a victory
over herself; she did not gratify a pert self-will
at the expense of propriety and decorum, and
she had no inclination to play the part of a
Quixote.</p>

<p>It is an easy thing for a young man to set
himself up as independent. The world with all
its various occupations is before him. He may
engage in as many freaks as suit his fancy; he
may dwell and live where and how he pleases;
but the case is widely different with a young
woman delicately brought up, respectably connected,
and desirous of retaining a respectable
condition and the countenance of her friends.
She is truly dependent, and must oftentimes
sacrifice her judgment and feelings to avoid more
serious and important sacrifices.</p>

<p>Penelope used to talk about dependence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
while under the roof of her benevolent and kind-hearted
relative, now no more. But she felt
it not then, as she felt it when her uncle had
departed from life. Then it was merely a name,
now it became a reality.</p>

<p>When the Countess had prevailed upon
Penelope to give her assent to the proposal of
publicly displaying her musical talents, her ladyship
was in exceeding good humour; and when
a lady of high rank is in good humour, her condescension,
her affability, her wit, her wisdom,
and whatever she pleases to assume or affect
of the agreeable and praiseworthy, are infinitely
above all language of commendation to such a
person as Mrs Greendale. The widow therefore
was quite charmed with the exquisitely lady-like
manners of the Countess, astonished at her
great good sense; and, had the Countess requested
it, Mrs Greendale herself would have
become a public singer.</p>

<p>While this negociation was going on at the
castle at Smatterton, another discussion concerning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
Penelope was passing at the rectory at
Neverden.</p>

<p>“Well, papa,” said Miss Darnley, “I took
particular notice of Penelope Primrose yesterday,
and purposely mentioned the name of Lord
Spoonbill, to see whether it would produce any
emotion, and I did not observe anything that
led me to suppose what you suspect.”</p>

<p>“Very likely, my child, you could not discern
it. That was not a time for the expression of
any such feelings. Her thoughts were then
otherwise engaged. But I can say that, from
what I have observed, I have no reason whatever
to doubt that her affections are not as they were
with respect to your brother. You know that
Robert wrote to her by the same conveyance
which brought us a letter, and although I gave
every opportunity and hint I could to that purpose,
Miss Primrose did not mention having
heard.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear papa,” replied Miss Darnley,
still unwilling to think unfavourably of so valued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
a friend as Penelope, “might not her thoughts
be otherwise engaged at the time, when you
visited her; for you recollect that your call was
much sooner after Dr Greendale’s death than
our’s was.”</p>

<p>Mr Darnley smiled with a look of incredulity,
and said, “You are very charitable in your judgment,
my dear, but I think in this instance you
extend your candour rather too far. I did not
only observe symptoms of alienation, but had, I
tell you, almost a proof of the fact. I went so
far as to allude to her engagement and to offer
our house as an asylum; and her reply was, that
she would be at the direction of Lady Smatterton.
Whether she be vain and conceited
enough to aspire to Lord Spoonbill’s hand, I
will not pretend to say, but I am abundantly
convinced that she does not regard your brother
with the same affection that she did some time
ago; and there certainly have been symptoms to
that effect in the course of her correspondence,
or Robert would never have used such language,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
or made such enquiries as he has in his last letter.
And I think it would be but an act of kindness,
or even of justice, to let your brother know what
are our suspicions.”</p>

<p>Now Mary Darnley, who was rather inclined
to be blue-stockingish, and had of course, a
mighty admiration for wisdom, and learning,
and science, thought it not unlikely that if
Penelope had changed her mind, and transferred
her affections to another, that other was more
likely to be Mr Kipperson than Lord Spoonbill.
For, she reasoned, it was not probable that a
young woman so brought up as Penelope had
been, should be at all pleased with a character
so profligate as Lord Spoonbill was generally
supposed to be. Then Mr Kipperson, though
he was double Penelope’s age, yet was a very
agreeable man, and far superior to the common
run of farmers; and he was a man of very
extensive information and of great reading. The
reasoning then went on very consequentially to
prove, that as Penelope loved reading, and as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
Mr Kipperson loved reading, therefore Penelope
must love Mr Kipperson. This perhaps was not
the best kind of reasoning in the world, yet it
might do in default of a better to support a
theory.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter is, that Miss Mary
Darnley herself was a little disposed to admire
Mr Kipperson, in virtue of his literary and
scientific character; and the truth also is, that
Mr Kipperson had really manifested symptoms
of admiration towards Penelope Primrose; and
last, but not least, is the truth, that Miss Mary
Darnley was somewhat inclined to be jealous of
the attention which the literary and scientific
Mr Kipperson had recently paid to Miss Primrose.</p>

<p>This theory of Miss Mary Darnley seemed the
most plausible, and it was therefore adopted by
her mother and sisters, and by them it was unanimously
concluded that Penelope was not
unfavourable to the suit of Mr Kipperson; and
then they thought that the young lady had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
behaved, or was behaving very ill to their brother;
and then they thought that their brother might
do much better for himself; and then they
thought that Mr Kipperson was at least fifty,
though till then it had been the common opinion
that he was but forty; and then they thought
that no dependence could be placed on any one;
and then they made many wise remarks on the
unexpectedness of human events, not considering
that the experience of millions, and the events
of centuries, have conspired to shew that events
take any other direction than that which is
expected. Ann Darnley was sorry for it, Martha
laughed at it, and Mary was angry with it.</p>

<p>As for Mr Darnley himself, he was not much
moved; but he could not admit of the idea that
he was wrong in his conjecture that Miss Primrose
was partial to Lord Spoonbill, therefore he
could not see the force of the reasoning which
went to prove, that the transfer of Penelope’s
affections was not from Robert Darnley to Lord
Spoonbill, but to Mr Kipperson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>“Beside,” said Mr Darnley, “is it likely that
a young woman of such high notions as Miss
Primrose should think of accepting an offer
from Mr Kipperson, who, though he is a man of
property and of literary taste, is still but a farmer,
or agriculturist. It is far more likely that the
vanity of the young lady should fix her hopes
on Lord Spoonbill, especially if his lordship has
paid her, as is not unlikely, very marked attentions.”</p>

<p>Although in the family at the rectory of
Neverden there was diversity of opinion as to
the person on whom Miss Primrose had placed
her affections, there was at least unanimity in
the feeling and expression of disapprobation.
And, in pursuance of this feeling, there was a
diminution, and indeed nearly a cessation of
intercourse between the parties. Many days
passed away, and no message and no visitor from
Neverden arrived at Smatterton.</p>

<p>This was deeply and painfully felt by Penelope,
and the more so as it was absolutely impossible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
for her to ask an explanation. Indeed, she concluded
that no explanation was wanting; the
fact that no letter had been received for so long
time, and the circumstance of the coldness and
change in the manners of the young ladies at
Neverden, were sufficient manifestations to
Penelope that, for some cause or other, there was
a change in the mind of Robert Darnley towards
her. Then in addition to these things was the
reflection, that she had allowed herself to be persuaded
contrary to her own judgment to adopt
the profession of music as a public singer, or at
least as a hired performer. Thus, in a very short
time, she was plunged from the height of hope to
the depth of despair. A little while ago she
had been taught to entertain expectations of her
father’s return to England in a state of independence;
she had also reason to hope that, the lapse
of a few months, there might come from a distant
land one for whom she did entertain a high
esteem, and who should become her guardian,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
and guide, and companion through life. A little
while ago also, she had in the society and
sympathy of her worthy and benevolent uncle,
Dr Greendale, a refuge from the storms of life,
and some consolation to enable her to bear up
aright under the pressure of life’s evils, its
doubts and its fears. All these hopes were now
vanished and dispersed, and she left to the mercy
of a rude world. Her best benefactor was in his
grave, and those very agreeable and pleasant
companions in whom he confided as in relatives,
and more than sisters, they also had deserted
her. It required a great effort of mind to bear
up under these calamities. Her mind however
had been habituated to exertion, and it had
gained strength from the efforts which it had
formerly made; but still her constitution was
not stoical; she had strong and deep feelings.
It was with some considerable effort that she
did not yield so far to the pressure of present
circumstances as to lose all elasticity of mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
and to relinquish all love of life. And pity itself
need not seek and cannot find an object more
worthy of its tears than one living, who has lost
all relish for life, and ceased to enjoy its brightness
or to dread its darkness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>


<p>Some few weeks after Penelope had given her
consent to the arrangement suggested by the
Countess of Smatterton, the family at the castle
took their departure for London. Her ladyship
did not forget her promise of providing Miss
Primrose with the means of cultivating and improving
her natural talents; but, in a very few
days after arriving in town, negociations were
entered into and concluded with an eminent professor
to take under his tuition a young lady
patronized by the Countess of Smatterton.</p>

<p>Great compliments of course were paid to the
judgment of the Countess, and high expectations
were raised of the skill and power of this new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
vocal prodigy; for countesses never patronize
anything but prodigies, and if the objects of their
patronage be not prodigies by nature, they are
very soon made so by art and fashion.</p>

<p>Now the Countess of Smatterton was really a
good judge of musical excellence; her taste was
natural, not acquired or affected as a medium of
notoriety, or a stimulus for languid interest in
life’s movements. And when her ladyship had
a musical party, which was indeed not unfrequently,
there was not one individual of the
whole assemblage more really and truly delighted
with the performances than herself, and few
perhaps were better able to appreciate their
excellence.</p>

<p>At this time but few families were in town,
and the winter assortment of lions, and prodigies,
and rages, was not formed or arranged. Lady
Smatterton would have been best pleased to
have burst upon the assembled and astonished
world at once with her new human toy. But
the good lady was impatient. She wished to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
enjoy as soon as possible the pleasure of exhibiting
to her friends and neighbours and rivals
the wonderful talents of Penelope Primrose. As
soon therefore as arrangements could be made
with the professor who was destined to be the
instructor of Miss Primrose, a letter was despatched
to Smatterton, desiring the young lady
to make as much haste as possible to town.</p>

<p>This was indeed a sad and painful trial to
Penelope. Little did she think that the plan
was so soon to be put in force to which she had
given her reluctant assent. It seemed inconsiderate
in her ladyship to remove Penelope from
Mrs Greendale so very soon; not that the young
lady had any very great reluctance to part from
Mrs Greendale; but as she had some reluctance
to make the journey to London for the object
which was in view, she felt rather more than
otherwise she would have done the inconvenience
to which it necessarily put her aunt.
Having therefore shewn Lady Smatterton’s letter
to the widow, she expressed her concern that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
Countess should be so very hasty in removing
her, and said, that if her aunt wished it she
would take the liberty of writing to her ladyship,
requesting a little longer indulgence, that she
might render any assistance which might be
needed under present circumstances.</p>

<p>Some persons there are who never will and
who never can be pleased: Mrs Greendale was
one of them. Instead of thanking Penelope for
her considerate and kind proposal, her answer
was:</p>

<p>“Indeed, Miss Primrose, I think you would
be acting very improperly to question Lady
Smatterton’s commands. I know not who is to
provide for you, if you thus turn your back upon
your best friends. I can assure you I have no
great need of any of your assistance, which I dare
say you would not be so ready to offer if it did
not suit your own convenience.”</p>

<p>To repeat much such language as this would
be wearisome. Suffice it to say, that there was
no form of expression which Penelope could use,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
nor any line of conduct which she could propose,
which Mrs Greendale was not ingenious enough
to carp at and object to. It may then be easily
imagined that the situation of our heroine was
not much to be envied; nor will it be supposed
that she felt any great reluctance to leave such a
companion and friend as this. With the best
grace imaginable, therefore, did Penelope prepare
for yielding obedience to Lady Smatterton’s commands;
but it was still with a heavy heart that
she made preparation for her journey.</p>

<p>Before her departure it was absolutely and
indispensably necessary that she should go
through the ceremony of taking leave of her
friends. Of several persons, whose names are
not here recorded, Penelope Primrose took leave,
with expressions of mutual regret. There was
however no embarrassment and no difficulty in
these cases. When, however, she prepared to
take leave of her friends at Neverden, the case
was widely different. Then arose much perplexity,
and then her heart felt such a bitter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
pang. It was probable that this would be a final
leave. The Darnleys never visited London, or
at least not above once in twenty years. They
had recently looked coldly upon her, and had
partially neglected her. It was contrary to their
general practice to act capriciously; there certainly
must be a motive for their behaviour, and
what could that motive be but a change in the
intentions of Robert Darnley with respect to herself.
The ground of that change she was at a
loss to determine. At all events she must call
and take leave of them.</p>

<p>In pursuance of this determination, Penelope
Primrose took, not the earliest, but the latest
opportunity of calling upon Mr Darnley and the
family at Neverden rectory; for it would not be
very pleasant to remain any time in the neighbourhood
after a cool and unfriendly separation
from those with whom so many of her pleasantest
hours had been spent, and with whose idea so
many of her hopes had been blended. When she
called, the whole family was at home. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
reception was by no means decidedly unkind, or
artificially polite. There was always indeed a
degree of stateliness in the manner of Mr
Darnley, and that stateliness did not appear any
less than usual, nor did it appear quite so
tolerable as on former days and on former
occasions.</p>

<p>In the young ladies, notwithstanding their
general good sense and most excellent education,
there was towards Penelope that kind of look,
tone, and address, which is so frequently adopted
towards those who once were equals, and whom
misfortune has made inferiors. Those of our
readers who cannot understand us here we sincerely
congratulate.</p>

<p>It had been made known to Mr Darnley for
what purpose Miss Primrose was making preparations
for a journey to London. But, though
the fact had been communicated, the reason for
that step had not been mentioned; not a word
had been said concerning the pressing importunity
of the Countess; nor was there any notice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
taken to him of the reluctance with which
Penelope had consented to this arrangement. It
appeared therefore to Mr Darnley that the
measure was quite in unison with the young
lady’s own wishes; nor did he see how incongruous
such a movement as this must be with his
suspicions of the aspiring views of his late
friend’s niece. At all events, this proceeding on
the part of Miss Primrose appeared to him, and
very naturally so, as a tacit relinquishment of
the engagement with his son: as it was impossible
for her not to know how repugnant it
must be to the feelings and taste of Mr Robert
Darnley. But as the elder Mr Darnley held the
clerical office, of the sanctity and dignity of
which he had very high ideas, he thought it but
part of his duty to administer a word or two of
exhortation to the young lady about to embark
in a concern of such a peculiar nature.</p>

<p>Now to render exhortation palatable, or even
tolerable, requires a very considerable share of
address and dexterity, more indeed than usually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
falls to the lot of clerical or of laical gentry. It is
easy enough to utter most majestically and
authoritatively a mass of common places concerning
the dangers to which young people are
exposed in the world. It is easy to say, “Now
let me advise you always to be upon your guard
against the allurements of the world, and to conduct
yourself circumspectly, and be very, very
attentive to all the proper decorums and duties of
your station.” Such talk as this anybody may
utter; and when young people commence life,
they expect to hear such talk; and for the most
part, to say the best of it, it produces no effect,
good, bad, or indifferent. It is also easy to
render exhortation painful and distressing, by
making it assume the form of something humiliating
and reproachful; and when it has also a
reference to some departed friend, or to circumstances
once bright, but now gloomy, and when
these references are founded on injustice, and
when this injustice cannot be refuted or rectified
without some explanation or explanations more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
painful still, then it is that exhortation is doubly
painful and distressing. So fell upon the ear
and heart of poor Penelope the exhorting language
of Mr Darnley.</p>

<p>When Penelope had first entered the apartment
she had announced the purpose of her call,
and had, by the assistance of the Darnleys,
stated the views with which she was going to
London: for so reluctant was she to mention the
fact, that its annunciation was almost extorted
from her by those who knew beforehand what
were her intentions. After a very little and very
cold common-place talk, uttered merely from a
feeling of the necessity of saying something, the
conversation dropped, and the parties looked
awkwardly at one another. Then did Mr
Darnley, assuming a right reverend look, address
himself to Miss Primrose.</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Primrose, before we part, let me
as your friend, and as a friend of your late
uncle, give you a little parting advice. I am
sorry that you have determined on taking this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
step, and had you condescended to consult me
on the subject, I certainly should have dissuaded
you from the undertaking. But, however, that is
past. Though I rather am surprised, I must
acknowledge that, recollecting as you must, how
strongly your late worthy uncle used to speak
against this pursuit, you should so soon after his
decease resolve to engage in it. But, however,
you are perfectly independent, and have a right to
do as you please. I do not say that in this pursuit
there is anything inconsistent with religion
and morality. I would by no means be so uncharitable.
But I should have thought, Miss
Primrose, that, considering your high spirit, you
would hardly have condescended to such an
employment; for I may call it condescension,
when I consider the prospects to which you were
born: but those, I am sorry to say, are gone. As
you have then fully resolved upon thus making a
public display of your musical talents, which, for
anything I know to the contrary, may be of the
highest order—for I do not understand music<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
myself—you will perhaps excuse me if, as a
friend of your late uncle, and really a well-wisher
to yourself, I just take the liberty to caution you
against the snares by which you are surrounded.
Beware of the intoxications of flattery, and do
not be unduly distressed if you should occasionally
in the public journals be made the subject of
ill-natured criticism. For I understand there
are many young and inexperienced writers who
almost regularly assail by severe criticism public
performers of every kind; and they make use of
very authoritative language. Now this kind of
criticism would be very offensive to a person who
was not aware that it is the production of ignorant,
conceited boys. I was once acquainted with a
young man who made acknowledgments to me
that have given me a very different view of the
critical art from that which I formerly entertained.
But, my good young lady, there are
severer trials which await you than these: you
will be very much exposed to the society of
the vicious and dissipated. You will have
need of all your caution and circumspection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
to take care that your religious and moral
principles be not weakened or impaired. I do
not say, indeed, that your profession is to be
esteemed irreligious or immoral; but it certainly
is exposed to many snares, and does require an
unusual share of attention. I hope you will not
neglect to attend church regularly and punctually.
It will assuredly be noticed if you neglect this
duty. Many will keep you in countenance should
you be disposed to slight the public ordinances
of religion; but there are also not a few who
patronize public musical performances, and who
also attend on religious worship: it is desirable
therefore to let these persons see that you are also
attentive to the duties of religion, I must add,
Miss Primrose, that I am concerned to find you
so bent upon this scheme. It would have given
me great pleasure, had all things proceeded
rightly, to afford you an asylum in this house till
the return of your father, or till any other change
had rendered such accommodation no longer
necessary. But, as circumstances now are, this
cannot be.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>It is easy to conceive what effect such language
as this must have had on the sensitive
mind and almost broken heart of Penelope Primrose.
It is very true that, in this address to her,
Mr Darnley had no malicious or cruel intention,
though every sentence which he uttered grieved
her to the very soul. Well was it for Penelope
that she was partly prepared for something of this
kind, and that her sorrows had crept upon her
gradually. Therefore she bore all this with a
most enduring patience, and never attempted to
make any explanation or apology otherwise than
by meekly and calmly replying to the elaborate
harangue of Mr Darnley:</p>

<p>“I thank you, sir, for your advice; I hope and
trust I shall attend to it; but I wish you to
understand that I am not acting purely according
to my own inclinations in adopting this employment.
I am sorry that I am under the necessity—”</p>

<p>The sentence was unfinished, and the tone in
which it was uttered excited Mr Darnley’s compassion:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
but he thought it very strange that
Miss Primrose should express any reluctance to
engage in a pursuit which, according to all appearance,
she had voluntarily and unnecessarily
adopted. The young ladies also were very sorry
for her, but still they could not help blaming her
mentally for her fickleness towards their brother;
for they were sure that he was attached to her,
and they plainly saw, or at least thought they
saw, that she had withdrawn her affections from
him. Penelope also was very well convinced, by
this interview with the family, that all her
hopes of Robert Darnley were gone.</p>

<p>To avoid any farther unpleasantness, she then
took leave of her late friends, and, with a very
heavy heart, returned to Smatterton to make immediate
preparation for her journey to London.
Alas! poor girl, she was not in a frame of mind
favourable to the purposes of festivity or the notes
of gladness. She, in whose heart was no gladness,
was expected to be the means of delighting others.
Thus does it happen, that the tears of one are the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
smiles of another, and the pleasures of mankind
are founded in each others pains. Never do the
burning words and breathing thoughts of poetry
spring with such powerful energy and sympathy-commanding
force, as when they come from a
heart that has felt the bitterness of grief, and
that has been agitated even unto bursting.</p>

<p>Our heroine would then have appeared to the
greatest advantage, and would then have commanded
the deepest sympathy in those moments
of solitude, which intervened between the last
leave-taking and her departure for a metropolis
of which she had seen nothing, heard much, and
thought little. But now her mind was on the
rack of thought, and so deeply and painfully was
it impressed, that her feeling was of the absolute
impossibility of effectually answering the designs
and intentions of her friend the Countess. She
could not bear to look back to the days that were
past—she felt an indescribable reluctance to look
forward, but her mind was of necessity forced in
that direction. All that spirit of independence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
and feeling of almost pride, which formed no
small part of her character, seemed now to have
taken flight, and to have left her a humble, destitute,
helpless creature. It was a pretty conceit
that came into her head, and though it was
sorrowful she smiled at it; for she thought that
her end would be swanlike, and that her first
song would be her last, with which she should
expire while its notes were trembling on her lips.</p>

</div>


<p>It was not very considerate of the Countess of
Smatterton to let a young lady like Penelope
Primrose take a long and solitary journey of
two hundred miles in a stage-coach without any
guide, companion, or protector. The Earl had
a very ample supply of travelling apparatus, and
it would have been quite as easy to have found
room for Penelope in one of the carriages when
the family travelled up to town. But they who
do not suffer inconveniences themselves, can
hardly be brought to think that others may.
Penelope felt rather mortified at this neglect, and
it was well for her that she did, as it was the
means of taking away her attention from more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
serious but remoter evil. It was also productive
of another advantage; for it gave Mr Kipperson
an opportunity of exhibiting his gallantry and
politeness. For, the very morning before Penelope
was to leave Smatterton, Mr Kipperson
called in person on the young lady, and stated
that imperious business would compel him to
visit the metropolis, and he should have infinite
pleasure in accompanying Miss Primrose on her
journey, and perhaps that might be more agreeable
to her than travelling alone or with total
strangers. Penelope could not but acknowledge
herself highly obliged by Mr Kipperson’s politeness,
nor did she, with any affectation or foolery,
decline what she might perhaps be compelled
to accept. On the following morning, therefore,
Miss Primrose, escorted by Mr Kipperson, left
the sweet village of Smatterton. That place had
been a home to Penelope from almost her earliest
recollections, and all her associations and thoughts
were connected with that place, and with its little
neighbour Neverden. Two hundred miles travelling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
in a stage-coach is a serious business to
one who has hardly ever travelled but about as
many yards. It is also a very tedious affair even
to those who are accustomed to long journies by
such conveyance. In the present instance, however,
the journey did not appear too long to either
of our travellers. For Penelope had looked forward
to the commencement of her journey with
too much repugnance to have any very great
desire for its completion, and Mr Kipperson was
too happy in the company of Miss Primrose to
wish the wheels of time, or of the coach, to put
themselves to the inconvenience of rolling more
rapidly than usual on his account. It was also
an additional happiness to Mr Kipperson that
there were in the coach with him two fellow
travellers who had long heard of his fame, but
had never before seen his person; and when they
discovered that they were in company with the
great agriculturist, and the great universal knowledge
promoter, Mr Kipperson, they manifested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
no small symptoms of satisfaction and admiration.</p>

<p>Now the mind of the scientific agriculturist
was so constructed as to experience peculiar
pleasure and delight at aught which came to his
ear in the form of compliment and admiration.
And, when Mr Kipperson was pleased, he was in
general very eloquent and communicative; and
he informed his fellow travellers that he was now
hastening up to London on business of the utmost
importance. He had received despatches
from town, calling him up to attend the House of
Commons, and to consult with, or rather to advise,
certain committees connected with the agricultural
interest. And he, the said Mr Kipperson,
certainly could not decline any call which the
deeply vital interests of agriculture might make
upon him. Thereupon he proceeded to shew
that there was no one individual in the kingdom
uniting in himself those rare combinations of
talent, which were the blessing and distinction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
of the celebrated Mr Kipperson of Smatterton;
and that if he should not pay attention to the
bill then before the House, or at least likely to
be before the House, by the time he should
arrive in London, the agricultural interest must
be completely ruined; there could be no remunerating
price, and then the farmers would throw
up their farms and leave the country, taking with
them all their implements, skill, forethought, and
penetration; and then all the land would be out
of cultivation, and the kingdom would be but
one vast common, only maintaining, and that
very scantily, donkeys and geese.</p>

<p>When the safety of a nation depends upon
one individual, that individual feels himself very
naturally of great importance. But perhaps this
is a circumstance not happening quite so often
as is imagined. Strange indeed must it be that,
if out of a population of ten or twelve millions,
only one or two can be found on whose wisdom
the state can rely, or from whose councils it can
receive benefit. But as the pleasure of imagining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
one’s self to be of importance is very great, that
pleasure is very liberally indulged in. And thus
the number of those rarities, called “the only
men in the world,” is considerably increased.
Now Mr Kipperson was the only man in the
world who had sagacity and penetration enough
to know wherein consisted the true interest of
agriculture; and he was most happy in giving
his time and talents to the sacred cause of high
prices. Enough of this: we do not like to be
panegyrical, and it is very probable that our
readers will not be much disappointed if we
protest that it is not our intention to enter very
deeply into the subject of political economy.
Indeed were we to enter very deeply into the
subject with which Mr Kipperson was intimate,
we should be under the necessity of making an
encyclopedia, or of plundering those already
made, beyond the forbearance of their proprietors.</p>

<p>That must be an exceedingly pleasant mode of
travelling which does not once, during a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
long journey, provoke the traveller to wish himself
at his journey’s end. Pleased as was Mr
Kipperson at the opportunity afforded him of
behaving politely to Miss Primrose, and gratified
as he was by the respectful veneration with
which his two other fellow travellers received
the enunciations of his oracular wisdom; fearful
as was Penelope that her new life would be the
death of her, and mourning as she was under
the actual loss of one most excellent friend,
and contemplating the possible loss of others,
still both were pleased to be at their journey’s
end.</p>

<p>It would have given Mr Kipperson great pleasure
to accompany Miss Primrose to the Earl of
Smatterton’s town residence; but it gave him
much greater pleasure to be able to apologize for
this apparent neglect, by saying that business of
a most important nature demanded his immediate
attendance in the city, and from thence to
the House of Commons; but that he should have
great pleasure in calling on the following morning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
to make enquiries after his fellow traveller, and
to pay his respects to his worthy and right
honorable neighbour, Lord Smatterton. For
although my Lord Smatterton was what the world
calls a proud man, yet he did admit of freedom
and a species of familiarity from some sort of
people; and a little freedom with a great man
goes a great way with a little man. Now Mr
Kipperson was one of those persons to whom the
Earl of Smatterton was most graciously condescending,
and with good reason was he condescending;
for this said Mr Kipperson, wishing
to keep up the respectability of the farming profession,
and though being much of a tenant,
and a little of a landlord, but hoping in due time
to be more of a landlord through an anticipated
inheritance, he gave all his mind to impress upon
his agricultural neighbours the importance of
keeping up prices, and he paid no small sum for
the farm which he tenanted under the Earl of
Smatterton. It may be indeed said with some
degree of truth, that he paid Lord Smatterton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
exceedingly well for his condescension; and as
his lordship was not much exposed to Mr Kipperson’s
invasions in London, he bore them with
great resignation and address when they did
happen. The Countess also was condescending
to Mr Kipperson, being very sensible of his value
to the Smatterton estate; so that the great and
scientific agriculturist appeared to visit this noble
family on terms of equality; and it is a fact that
he thought himself quite equal, if not rather
superior, to the Smatterton nobleman. It was a
pleasure to Mr Kipperson to enjoy this conceit;
and it did no one any injury, and it is a pity that
he should be disturbed in the possession of the
fancy.</p>

<p>The nobility do not act judiciously when they
admit of any other token of distinction than
actual rank. When once they adopt any fanciful
distinction from fashion, or <i>ton</i>, or impudence,
for they are nearly the same, the benefit of the
civil distinction is at once renounced, and there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
is no established immoveable barrier against
innovation. A merchant, or the son of a merchant,
may by means of an imperturbable self-conceit,
or by force of commanding impudence,
push himself up into the highest walks of life,
and look down upon nobility. Though the biographer
of a deceased statesman may express his
lament that nobility does not admit talent <i>ad
eundem</i>, yet there is danger lest nobility should
hold its hereditary honors with too light a hand.
Lord Smatterton indeed was not guilty of neglecting
to preserve upon his own mind, or endeavouring
to impress on the minds of others, a due
and full sense of his own importance. Even to
Mr Kipperson his familiarity was obviously condescension,
though not so felt or regarded by
Mr Kipperson himself. We will leave this
gentleman for awhile to go and transact important
business in the city, and we will attend
upon Miss Primrose.</p>

<p>As soon as the poor girl had found her way to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
the residence of the Countess of Smatterton, she
was received by her ladyship with the greatest
kindness.</p>

<p>“Now, my dear Miss Primrose, this is very
good of you to come up to town so soon. But
how did you come—you did not come all the way
by yourself. Surely you did not travel by the
stage coach?”</p>

<p>Penelope informed her ladyship concerning her
fellow traveller, and expressed herself perfectly
well satisfied with the mode of travelling which
she had adopted.</p>

<p>“Well, that was fortunate; but really, if I
had thought of it in time, you might have come
with our family when we travelled up. But I
am very glad you are come. You will be quite
indispensable to us to-morrow evening. I am
happy to see you looking so well, and how did
you leave Mrs Greendale? Poor woman! Her
loss is very great!”</p>

<p>Fortunately for Penelope, the Countess was not
one of those unreasonable persons who ask questions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
for the sake of answers, but one of those,
who are not a small number, who ask questions
purely for the sake of asking them, and by way
of shewing their own very great condescension in
deigning to ask so particularly concerning what
interests their inferiors. It is however not good
policy that the models of politeness should, in
their manifest heedlessness of answers to their
questions, so decidedly testify to their own insincerity
and heartlessness.</p>

<p>Penelope was glad to be liberated from the
interview with her ladyship, and to enjoy for a
while the solitude which her apartment afforded.
An apartment had been provided for her reception
in the town residence of the Earl of Smatterton;
and though the ascent to it was rather laborious,
yet it had the blessed comfort of affording to the
troubled one an opportunity of sitting alone, and
shedding a few tears, and communing with her
own heart. There are some states of mind in
which the sufferer feels most and greatest consolation
in being left to the thoughts of solitude.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
There was however even in solitude nothing
pleasing for Penelope to meditate upon: but
hope is an artist that draws its finest scenes upon
the darkest ground. Amidst all the losses which
she had experienced, and the pains which she had
suffered, and the dreaded anticipations of evils
yet to come, still Penelope could think that her
father was yet living, and might perhaps soon
make his appearance in England, and fulfil those
promises of which she had often indirectly heard.
It was painful to her that she could not form any
idea of her father. She had always regarded him
as an object of compassion; for her uncle in the
candour of his heart never uttered words of reproach
against Mr Primrose; but, when he spoke
of him, called him his poor brother, his unfortunate
kinsman, and he always seemed to regard
him as a victim to others’ vices and not to his
own. Penelope could not form an idea of a being
more fatherly than Dr Greendale had always been
to her; and whenever her young ears caught
the sound of sympathy or sorrow for her lot as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
a poor fatherless child, she denied in her own
heart the applicability of such language to herself.
She knew that she had a father living
abroad, but she felt that a father had died at
home. When, however, upon this absent living
father Penelope knew that her only hope and
dependence could rest, then did she with more
fixedness of mind direct her thoughts and prayers
thitherward. It was some consolation to her that
some little time must elapse before she could by
any possibility make her appearance in public;
this would be some alleviation, and might perhaps
produce some change. The language however
which the Countess had used respecting to-morrow,
seemed to indicate that some commencement
of publicity was destined for her even at
that early date. And this thought was a dark
spot in the picture of hope. So all the bright
expectations which mortals cherish, have in their
foreground something harshly real and coarsely
literal. Many hours however the poor deserted
one did not meditate upon melancholy, or on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
brighter scenes. The weariness which had
resulted from her long journey, and the agitation
of spirits which she had suffered, were too much
for her strength, and she soon sank to the silence
of repose. Happy was it for her that the outlines
of her destiny were but faintly traced; she
scarcely knew for what mode of public display
her patroness had designed her; but she could
and did hope for the best. In all her thoughts
the image of Robert Darnley was not in her
mind’s eye for any length of time; it frequently
made its appearance, and as frequently it was
dismissed; not in anger—not, or scarcely, in
sorrow, but in resignation and philosophy. She
had endeavoured to wean her mind from the
thought of a fickle lover, without having recourse
to hatred, reproach or resentment. She exercised
great diligence to cultivate a degree of indifference,
and she so far deceived herself as to
fancy that she had succeeded. Youth never so
thoroughly deceives itself as when it says, “I
don’t care.”</p>

</div>


<p>Another day dawned upon the multitudinous
interests and emotions of humanity. To the
mind which can spare time from the intensity
of its own feelings, and the selfishness of its
own concerns, to think of others—to think, not
merely to talk morality and sentiment about
them, but to realise the emotions and agitations
of thoughts which harass the human breast,
there is in the thought of a day dawning in a
great city a deep and serious fulness of interest.
The sun’s first blush upon the mountains and
woods and streams and spangled meadows, is
poetical and pretty enough, but the same light
beaming on the condensed and crowded habitations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
of men, brings to the mind far other
thoughts, and excites widely different emotions.
It awakens misery from its dreams of bliss,
and guilt from its dreams of innocence, poverty
from its dreams of wealth, and despair from its
dreams of hope. Anxiety begins anew its busy
work in the breast of the needy parent, and
gnawing hunger oft reminds the sufferer of
the opening of another day. Bitter are the
feelings which morning ofttimes brings to the
sons and daughters of poverty; but not to
them alone are confined the agonizing throbs
of the heart. There is among the inmates
of those proud mansions which seemed built
for festivity alone, and tenanted by luxury
and repose, many, many a bitter pang. There
is the thought of keener anguish than any
mere physical privation or suffering can inflict,
there are pangs of heart for which language
has no words, and fancy no figures, there are
fears and dreads of which the humbler sufferers
of life’s ills have no conception. Not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
enviable were the feelings of our heroine on
the first morning in which she woke in the
great city.</p>

<p>Then did she feel her truly desolate and
destitute condition. She had been as a beauteous
flower hanging on a slender film over
the current of a river, that film had broken,
and the flower had dropped upon the stream
at the mercy of its waves. With the opening
day there had been accustomed to enter
into her mind thoughts of devotion and gratitude.
These thoughts came, but not as
usual. It seemed to her as though she had
not been sufficiently thankful to her Creator
for his blessings, and that they had been
withheld. She would have prayed but she
dared not, she would have wept but she could
not. Her bodily fatigue was gone, but the
weariness of mind was felt more strongly.
She endeavoured to compose her scattered
thoughts, but that was a task of no small
difficulty. One of the greatest concerns of all,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
however, was, that by this new arrangement
she was placed out of all communication with
her father; for the late Dr Greendale was the
only person in England with whom Mr Primrose
had any correspondence. It was even
doubtful whether Mrs Greendale herself knew
his address. These circumstances, therefore,
though they might not break off his communication
with England, would naturally produce
a long and serious interruption to it. For
her own part, it was out of her power to
convey to her father any knowledge of her
situation, so as to be able by his intervention
to avoid that publicity which she so
much dreaded.</p>

<p>Not long had her mind been thus painfully
occupied, before she received a visit in her
apartment from her friend Lady Smatterton:
and as she was now totally dependent on her
ladyship, she was desirous of conciliating her
regards as much as possible; nor indeed was
that a very difficult task. A little sense of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
humility and feeling of obligation and submission
to her ladyship’s superior wisdom,
would always ensure the Countess of Smatterton’s
good will. When, therefore, Penelope with
great humility, and a look of gratification,
expressed her thanks to her ladyship for
her very kind attentions, the Countess being
pleased to see that her condescension had
made its impression, was in very high spirits,
and became more gracious and condescending
still.</p>

<p>“My dear Miss Primrose, you look quite
charmingly this morning. I am delighted to
find that you have not experienced any inconvenience
from the fatigue of your journey.
I think you will be in most excellent voice
this evening. Now, I expect a few select
friends to-night; and some of them are amateurs,
and I assure you I have promised them
a treat, in which I know they will not be
disappointed. I have all your favourite songs
and duets, so you may make your selection in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
the course of the morning; and I have a new
harp which I wish you to try. I think you
will like it.”</p>

<p>With a very great effort to suppress a very
deep sigh, Penelope replied: “I shall be
most happy to use my best exertions to
gratify your ladyship, but I fear that before
so many persons who are total strangers to
me, and without any previous scientific instruction,
I may disappoint the expectations
which your ladyship’s kindness has excited.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear no, my dear, I beg you will
not entertain any such notion; we shall have
a very small party indeed, and of the amateurs,
I can assure you that there is not one
that is half so well acquainted with the
science of music as you are. It will be time
enough for you to take lessons previously to
your performance in public, and that not
because you need musical instruction, but
there are certain peculiarities which it is
necessary that public performers should know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>Miss Primrose, knowing how much the
Countess disliked objections to any of her
own arrangements, submitted as resignedly as
she could; but with a feeling that neither
her bodily nor mental strength were equal to
the task which awaited her. The visit of the
Countess concluded with requesting Penelope
to take her breakfast with the family, unless
she preferred being quite alone. But Penelope
found little pleasure in solitude, and
therefore very readily accepted the invitation
to take breakfast at the family table, where
she very soon after made her appearance.</p>

<p>At this table there sat down the Earl and
Countess of Smatterton and Lord Spoonbill.
This was the usual party, and Penelope was
received by them all three with so much
kindness, and such genuine politeness of manner,
that she felt herself no stranger. And
they all asked very kindly after Mrs Greendale,
and they all hoped that Miss Primrose
had not suffered from the fatigue of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
journey; and when Lord Spoonbill asked how
Miss Primrose had travelled, and when he
heard that she had travelled by the stage-coach
in company with Mr Kipperson, he
was astonished and grieved; and he thought
it a great pity that arrangements had not
been previously made for accommodating the
young lady in one of their carriages. The
Earl also expressed himself much concerned at
the same neglect. Alas, thought Penelope,
what a multitude of words on trifles. How
she had travelled was now nothing to her,
but it was something to her when she thought
for what purpose that journey had been made.</p>

<p>Lord Spoonbill, after a proper interval, and
with a very becoming seriousness of manner,
gently adverted to the death of Dr Greendale,
and perceiving that it was a subject on which
Penelope loved to dwell, notwithstanding the
melancholy and painful associations connected
with it, he proceeded to extol the virtues of
her deceased relative, and to express his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
great obligations to the good man for the
many valuable pieces of advice he had received
from the late rector of Smatterton; he
thought that it was a great pity that some
of the doctor’s sermons should not be given
to the public, for they would undoubtedly be
productive of good. Penelope was very well
pleased, and indeed quite interested by the
manner in which Lord Spoonbill condescended
to speak of her departed relative; and she
began to think that his lordship was not
quite so great a coxcomb as she had once
taken him to be. Gradually her mind recovered
a little of its natural vivacity, and her
looks resumed part of their wonted cheerfulness.
She was comparatively easy and composed.
Then did the young nobleman ingeniously,
and without forced transition, turn the
conversation to other topics, and he spoke
much of the metropolis and its many magnificences;
but with peculiar delicacy avoided
saying anything of public concerts. Penelope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
felt grateful for such kind and considerate attentions,
and began to think that in the manners of
the higher ranks there was something peculiarly
fascinating which could render such a man as
Lord Spoonbill not only tolerable but really agreeable.
The Earl of Smatterton was also very
courteous and kind to his guest, though he could
not well avoid majestic manifestations of his
kindness. He condescended to hope that Miss
Primrose would find herself happy in the metropolis,
and dwelt with much complacency on
the opportunity she would enjoy of introduction
to society; and he spake largely of the patronizing
propensities of the Countess; he also
mentioned other titled ladies, to whose saloons
the young dependent might be admitted; and
concluded a long harangue by saying, that on
proper occasions she would be a welcome guest
at his own house.</p>

<p>Now it happened that on the breakfast table
there was lying a newspaper, which was occasionally
taken up and laid down by one or other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
of the noble family of Smatterton. Penelope
was not a politician, but seeing the words “Ship
News” printed in distinct and distantly visible
characters, she felt some curiosity to read that
same news, for she thought it possible that there
might be in that article something deeply interesting
to herself. It appeared however to her
that it would be making herself rather too much
at home to take up the paper; she endeavoured
therefore as it lay to catch a glimpse of the intelligence.
Lord Spoonbill observed the direction
of her eyes, and very politely offered her the
paper, which she thankfully accepted. Just as
she was in the act of directing her eyes towards
that part of the paper which contained the intelligence
most important to her, something addressed
to her by Lord Smatterton called her away from
the page almost in the very moment that the
name of Primrose caught her eye. And as Penelope
laid down the paper on being spoken to
by his lordship, Lord Spoonbill took it up again,
and by some means or other it was no longer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
visible. What she had seen was enough to excite
strong feelings and to raise her hopes. She had a
recollection of the word “arrived,” and the name
of “Primrose” among the list of passengers; at
least so it seemed to her from the hasty glance
which she had taken of the paper. This of course
was quite sufficient to fill her mind with the most
pleasing visions for the rest of the day: and
hearing that Mr Kipperson might very probably
be one of the party in the evening, and knowing
that this gentleman was deeply versed in matters
of business, it occurred to her that he might
bring her some pleasing intelligence from the
city touching the arrival of vessels from the East
Indies, and the names of passengers. It is true,
there might be one of the name of Primrose and
still no relation of hers. But she might at least
enjoy the hope as long as possible; and it would
cheer her spirit amidst the darkness of reality.</p>

<p>The evening came, and with it the few select
friends of the Countess of Smatterton, who were
to compose her party. There were not many persons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
in town at this time; but Penelope had
never before seen anything bearing the slightest
resemblance to a fashionable party, for she had
never been at the Easter ball at the Mansion
house, or at Bartholomew fair; to her therefore
this very small select party looked like a very
tumultuous and promiscuous multitude. Every
face was strange to her, and as the apartments
were splendidly lighted up, the drawing and
music rooms opening into each other, and displaying
by means of mirrors a deceiving appearance
as to their real dimensions. Thus magnified
and multiplied, they looked to her unpractised
eye as awfully public as a great theatre. Part of
the company was assembled before Penelope
made her appearance. When therefore she entered
the middle drawing-room, which was the
apartment most usually occupied by the family,
she was surprised at the sight of lighted apartments
on both sides of this, and these apartments
to her eye filled with elegant company. She was
still more surprised at entering the room to find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
that no one took the slightest notice of her in the
way of courtesy, but that three or four young
gentlemen who were standing together near a fire-place
absolutely and immovably stared at her:
and then, as soon as she caught sight of the
Countess of Smatterton, she observed that her
ladyship was engaged in conversation with a great,
broad, coarse, overdressed female, who was talking
very loud and looking very majestically. This
stranger appeared like a very vulgar woman to
our unfashionable heroine, but was in reality no
less a personage than the Duchess of Steeple
Bumstead. Her Grace put her glass to her eye,
and contemplated by its means the face and
figure of Penelope. The poor girl felt very uncomfortable
and ill at ease being thus gazed at so
unmercifully. As soon as her Grace had satisfied
her curiosity she dropt her glass, and wheeled
round and sailed away in another direction. The
Countess of Smatterton then approached the
confused and embarrassed dependent, and after
giving her a good-humoured rebuke for making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
her appearance in such very sable attire, told her
that the Duchess of Steeple Bumstead was very
desirous of hearing her sing.</p>

<p>Penelope saw by the nearest mirror that the
aspect of her attire was dark indeed, but dark as
it was it could not express the mourning which
she felt for her great loss. She was by no means
in a proper frame of mind for the enjoyment of
society, or at all fit for anything that wore the
aspect of festivity. She suffered herself to be
led into the music-room by the Countess, and she
made a most respectful curtesy to the Duchess
of Steeple Bumstead, when she had the honor of
being introduced to a personage of such elevated
rank. But still Penelope could not help thinking
that fashionable manners were not agreeable: for
she recollected that her late uncle used to define
politeness as being that kind of behaviour which
was least calculated to give pain to others; and
yet Penelope felt more pain from the behaviour
of the Duchess of Steeple Bumstead, and that of
some of the whiskered boys in Lady Smatterton’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
drawing room, than she would have felt from
persons not so high in rank and so fashionable
in manners. All that arose from her ignorance
of ways of the world. Why did she take the
opinion of her uncle as oracular in those matters
of which he could not possibly know anything
at all? A country clergyman, who studies
books all his life-time, can know nothing of the
world.</p>

<p>The Duchess was pleased to question Penelope
on the subject of music, and was pleased to express
her approbation of the good taste which the
young lady displayed. By degrees the manners
of her Grace appeared less repulsive, and Penelope
felt herself more at her ease. There was
standing by the pianoforte a young lady of mild,
pleasing, and prepossessing countenance, to
whom the Duchess addressed herself:</p>

<p>“My dear Jemima, you will perhaps have the
goodness to accompany Miss Primrose on the
pianoforte to some song, if there be one there
that our friend would like to sing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>The young lady expressed great readiness to
oblige the Duchess—and the leaves of many
books were turned over. It was not difficult to
find a song that Penelope was familiar with, but
it was difficult to find one which did not bring by
its language or its expression some association
painful and distressing to her mind. The Duchess
was very patient during the search, and at length
a piece was selected. Miss Primrose had a style
of singing peculiarly her own. It was not marked
by any very strong singularity, but its decided
character was expression: and she shone most in
those songs which admit of what may be called
the rhetoric of music. There was also a very
considerable degree of emotion in her musical
expression, and it required a skilful hand to accompany
her. That requisite she now had. As
her voice was full and deep, it was also searching,
and those who were within its reach felt themselves
as it were addressed by the singer. This
style was truly commanding and attractive. The
company gradually surrounded the performer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
and well for her she knew not till the song was
finished, that any one was attending to her
besides the Duchess of Steeple Bumstead and the
Countess of Smatterton.</p>

<p>Very abundant and very sincere applause followed
the music’s close. But the music or the
applause was too much for our heroine, and she
nearly fainted; kind and prompt assistance soon
recovered her, and thus she was saved from an
immediate repetition of that which her hearers
would gladly have heard again. There was
much talk in the room as to, who is she? But
few could answer the question. One impertinent
coxcomb said “She looks too modest to be a
woman of great fashion.”</p>

<p>Just at this moment who should enter the
room but Peter Kipperson, Esq.! Peter was in
all his glory. He had been occupied during the
whole of the day in business of the utmost importance.
He had been consulted and had given
his advice, and his advice had been taken. He
now presented himself to Lady Smatterton’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
party, in which were several members of parliament,
and as these were mostly men of business,
Peter was personally known to most of them,
and he received and returned their salutations
with great self-satisfaction. Peter was an active
little man, and he was nimbly moving about the
apartments in search of Miss Primrose; but
before he could meet with her he encountered
the Earl of Smatterton.</p>

<p>“Mr Kipperson,” said his lordship, “I am
most happy to see you. Have you met your
committee to-day in the city? Have you taken
any farther steps in that business, of which you
were speaking to me the other day at Smatterton?
Really, Mr Kipperson, something must be done,
it is becoming a very serious affair. Those merchants
are very crafty, selfish people. We must
put a stop to their encroachments before it is too
late.”</p>

<p>“My lord,” replied Mr Kipperson, “I am
very happy to have it in my power to assure you
that the resolution which I suggested is adopted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
I was forced to use all my powers of persuasion.
I said to them in so many words, ‘Gentlemen,’
says I, ‘Gentlemen, if you do not adopt this
resolution, the nation is ruined, we shall have the
country deluged with corn, and we shall of
course be all starved.’”</p>

<p>“That was excellent, Mr Kipperson; you have
saved the nation. I see you have right views of
the matter.”</p>

<p>Several members also of the lower house, who
were present, expressed themselves to the same
effect; and it was very satisfactory to Mr Kipperson
to think that he had so timely and wisely
interfered with his prodigious wisdom to save the
nation from being starved.</p>

<p>After many interruptions, the wise and learned
agriculturist found his way to Penelope Primrose;
and in answer to her interrogations concerning
what she thought she had seen in the papers of
the morning, informed her that two or three of the
Company’s ships had arrived, that in one of them
there certainly was a passenger named Primrose.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
By Mr Kipperson’s answer to a few more interrogations,
Penelope was nearly certain that this
could be no other than her long lost father. The
very possibility of such an event was agitating
to her mind, and the increasing probability of it
was too great for her weak spirits to bear. A
thousand thoughts at once confusedly rushed
into her mind. She knew not how to inform her
father of her present situation. She was doubtful
whether he was returning home dependent or
independent. She supposed that he would in
the first instance find his way to Smatterton, and
then it must be some days before she could see
him. These and many more like considerations
entered into her mind, and their united influence
was such as to harass and perplex her beyond
measure. She was most happy when the evening
party of the Countess had dispersed, and when
she was left alone to meditation and to hope.
Then she endeavoured to conjecture on the probability
of being rescued from the publicity
which so awfully and imminently threatened her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
and with these thoughts others also entered
the mind, and none of them were of a nature to
soothe or compose.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, that these various agitating
feelings, and this new life into which Penelope
was so unexpectedly and so painfully thrown,
conspired together to produce a serious illness.</p>

</div>


<p>There are few, perhaps, of our female readers
who could have passed through what Penelope
was compelled to suffer, without sinking under
the weight of such an accumulation of distressing
circumstances. The wonder is, that she bore up
so long, rather than that she sunk at last.</p>

<p>It is with reluctance that we withdraw the
attention of our readers from the bedside of the
dependent sufferer. We can only state that the
Countess was very assiduous in her attentions to
her patient, that the best medical assistance was
immediately procured, that Lord Spoonbill was
very regular in his enquiries, and that the Earl
of Smatterton desired that the young woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
might not want for anything that was useful or
that might contribute to her comfort and recovery.
He said so every morning.</p>

<p>It is now absolutely necessary that we violate
two of the unities, viz. of time and place. We
must violate the unity of time, by doing what
time itself with all its power cannot do; we must
go backwards; and we must also violate the
unity of place, by transporting our readers to
the island of St Helena. Their expatriation will
be but short.</p>

<p>About the beginning of November, in the year
18—, two of the Company’s ships touched at this
island in their passage homeward. The crews
and the passengers were not sorry to have such
symptoms of home as this accidental meeting
produced. Those of the passengers who were
going to England for the last time, found in the
word “last” a different charm from any which
Dr Johnson attributes to it, in the last paper of
the Rambler. It was a cheerful and animating
feeling which pervaded their bosoms, a sentiment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
joyous even to tears. The first enquiries of all
were for news from England, and the post-office
was an object of general attraction. There were
to be seen there cheerful and disappointed countenances,
but every one was too much occupied
with his own thoughts to take any notice of
others.</p>

<p>There came out of the office a middle-aged
stout gentleman, reading with great seriousness
and emotion a letter which he held open in his
hands, and there passed him and entered into
the office a younger man, a fine tall handsome
man, who would naturally have excited any one’s
attention by the mere force of his appearance;
but the middle-aged gentleman was too deeply
engaged to notice him at the moment. In a few
seconds the younger of the two came out of the
office, not reading a letter, but holding one in
his hand unopened; and looking upon that one
more sadly than he would have done had it been
accompanied with another. Presently he also
opened his letter and read it, not cheerfully, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
sorrowfully, but anxiously and enquiringly. The
letter was finished and returned to his pocket;
and he endeavoured to look more cheerfully, but
his efforts failed. He quickened his pace, and
presently he overtook the middle-aged gentleman;
and, as they were passengers in different
ships, they looked at each other rather earnestly,
and the elder greeted the younger. The young
man returned the greeting readily, and, as well as
he could, cheerfully. The elder stranger said,
that he was going to see the place where Bonaparte
was buried; the younger was going to the
same place, but he called it the tomb of Napoleon.
The elder did not quarrel about the expression,
but took the young man’s offered arm,
and they walked very sociably together.</p>

<p>Very few words passed between them on their
way to the place of their destination; and when
they arrived there they both seemed to feel a
little disappointment that there was not something
more to gratify their curiosity, or to excite
emotion. Place, considered in itself, has no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
charm. The imagination must make the mystery
all for itself, and that it may do absent as well as
present. Nebuchadnezzar was not unreasonable
when he desired that his wise men should tell him
his dream, as well as the interpretation thereof:
for if they really had wisdom from heaven for one
purpose, they would as likely have wisdom for
the other. So it is with place connected with
the memory of the distinguished sons of mortality.
The imagination can as well form the
place to the mind’s eye as it can fill the place
when seen with these emotions and feelings,
which we expect to be excited by such views.</p>

<p>The elder stranger turning to the younger, said,
“What is your real opinion of Napoleon Bonaparte?”</p>

<p>“He was certainly a great man,” was the safe
and quiet answer. The elder did not make any
immediate reply to this enunciation of opinion on
the part of his young companion. The other
therefore supposed, and very naturally, that the
answer which he had given was not altogether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
satisfactory. He proceeded, therefore, but still
cautiously:—“He was a man of great ambition;
and he was also a disappointed man.” All this
seemed but the echo of everybody’s opinion, let
their view of the man’s character otherwise be
what it may. The elder stranger then spoke
again:</p>

<p>“I do not think he was a great man. The
word great is an epithet too comprehensive to be
applicable to a disappointed man. To be a great
man, it is necessary that there should be in the
mind those powers and that forethought which
will guard against frustration and disappointment.
Greatness is not in place and in name, it
is purely in the mind. I will grant you that
Napoleon Bonaparte had great military powers—great
legislative powers—great discernment of
human character; but he was not great over
himself: he wanted power to guide his power.
And let a man have all other powers and all other
talent, if he have not the power of power and the
talent of talent, he may be a distinguished, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
may be a notorious man, he may produce grand
effects; but he will not be a great man. True
greatness is calm; for it feels and guides its own
power.”</p>

<p>The young man listened to this, and to more
than this; for the elder one was more voluble
than we have represented him. He perhaps
loved paradox; many persons do; and some love
to listen to paradox, if it be agreeably uttered,
and be not too obviously a determined contradiction
of the common feelings and opinions of
mankind. The young man then replied:</p>

<p>“But Napoleon produced great changes in
men’s minds, and great effects on the frame of
civil society, and he has left many monuments of
his wisdom.”</p>

<p>“True,” replied the elder one: “Napoleon, as
you call him, has done much in the world, and
perhaps more than any other individual in whose
ambitious steps he seems to have trodden. But
he was raised up by a wise Providence to teach
humanity that it may grasp at what is beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
its power. Alexander was a lesson merely to
warriors; Cæsar to men of intrigue and aspiring
talent; Bonaparte to men of consummate talent
of almost every description; and if the world be
not pestered with a hero till there shall rise a
man of greater talents than Napoleon Bonaparte,
it may rest in peace for many centuries.”</p>

<p>“I never took that view of the subject,” replied
the young man. “There is however something
in what you say. Still I cannot but think
that Napoleon was a great man.”</p>

<p>“According to your opinions of greatness, no
doubt he was. But I have told you my ideas of
greatness, and according to those he was not.
Greatness requires consistency and uniformity;
and it is not in a man of disappointed ambition
that we look for those characters. It seems to
be the ordinance of heaven, that all its blessings
should not centre in one individual among created
beings. Where it bestows wit, it does not always
grant wisdom to direct it; where it gives power,
it does not always bestow discretion to use that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
power, of whatever quality it may be, according
to the best possible principles. True greatness
implies wisdom, and wisdom in man makes the
most of and does the best with its means. Now
I have at this moment a letter in my pocket from
England, bringing me an account of a good, and,
I think, great man. But he was nothing more
than the humble rector of a small parish in the
country. He was by no means a man of great
genius; nor was he a man of great eloquence;
but he was a man of great moral power. I will
venture to affirm that, whatever were the moral
capabilities of the parish over which he presided
as pastor, he would call them forth to the utmost.
It is owing to that man that I am now living,
and comparatively happy. It is owing to me,
perhaps,”——</p>

<p>Here the voice of the speaker was interrupted
by the swelling of his bosom, and he passed his
hand convulsively on his forehead and gave way
to an agony of tears and sobs, which it would
have been painful to witness in a younger person,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
but which was quite distressing to see in one of
such appearance and at such an age; for he
seemed full fifty years of age, and had the
appearance of a man of good understanding and
gentlemanly manners. The young man took him
by the hand and faintly uttered a few words of
consolation, that he might a little abate a sorrow
which he could not wholly stay.</p>

<p>When the violence of the emotion had a little
subsided, and the sufferer had regained the power
of speech, he first asked pardon for his weakness,
and apologised for having given way to his feelings.
“For,” continued he, “I have lost a
benefactor just at a moment when I was flattering
myself that I should be able to thank him for his
kindness, and to gratify him by letting him know
that his kindness had not been in vain, and that
his friendly admonitions had not all been lost.
I will not so far encroach upon your patience as
to tell you my history; but I cannot forbear
from indulging in the pleasure which I mention—the
conduct of this most excellent man towards
me and my family.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>“I shall have great pleasure, sir,” replied the
young man, “in listening to any particulars with
which you may be pleased to favour me. The
history of the human mind is always interesting
and always instructive.”</p>

<p>With this encouragement the elder stranger
proceeded: “This most excellent man, of whose
death I have been speaking, was a clergyman,
whose unfortunate sister I married more than
twenty years ago. I respected and honored him
when I first knew him for the purity and simplicity
of his manners. He was of a respectable
family, but not wealthy: his living was nearly
his whole maintenance. I could never induce
him to spend a week with us in town. He
always pleaded his parochial duties as demanding
his whole attention. It was in vain for me, or
for any one else, to suggest any hint respecting
preferment or bettering his circumstances by the
ordinary means of professional advancement.
During the whole of the time I resided in England
after my marriage, I saw nothing of my
respected brother-in-law. We had, it is true,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
several letters from him, and letters of a most
interesting description. Well would it have
been for me, and well for my dear child, and
well for my beloved companion, had I regarded
these letters as something more than models
of epistolary correspondence; had I attended
to those kind paternal hints which they contained.
They gave me admonition without assuming
airs of superiority or the affectations of a
would-be hermit. He wrote to me in the world,
and as from the world, making allowances for all
the temptations with which I was surrounded,
and speaking of them as if he had not learned
their existence or ascertained their nature merely
by the means of books or talk. I was content
with admiring the good man’s virtues. I did not
seek to imitate them. I suffered one scoundrel
after another to creep into an intimacy with me,
and in a very few years my patrimony was
wasted, and all my inheritance was melted away
at the gaming-table.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>There was again, at these words, a pause of
passionate and deep feeling, but it passed away,
and the emotion subsided, and the narrator went
on to say:</p>

<p>“Then, sir, I became a widower. My beloved
partner left me an only child, a daughter, for
whom I resolved to live, or, more properly speaking,
for whose sake I endeavoured to preserve
and support life, which without this stimulus
would have been a burden too heavy to be borne.
I took my poor little innocent child to this venerable
and amiable clergyman. I found even then
nothing like reproach. The good man pitied
me, and he pitied my child. His pity touched
me more sorely and more deeply than any reproaches
which human language could have
uttered. I felt my heart melt within me. I
dared not say a word of exculpation. I stood
self-condemned. I proposed to leave my native
land, and to seek elsewhere the means of maintenance
for myself and my child. He offered to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
take my little girl and be a father to her: and he
has been so.</p>

<p>She, poor innocent, hardly knows that she has
any other father. I am to her but as a name;
but I do long most ardently once more to see her.
I think years have not so altered her that I shall
not recognize her. I have pleased myself during
my long exile of sixteen years with forming to
myself an image of my dear child growing up to
woman’s estate; and the miniature likeness of
her dear mother assists my imagination now in
forming an idea of my daughter. She is now
expecting my return; and the last letter which I
received of my most excellent brother-in-law, informed
me that the poor girl had bestowed her
affections, and would with my approbation bestow
her hand, on a worthy and respectable man. I
left all these matters to my relative in England.
I was sure that he would act towards my child
as a parent, and as a wiser and more truly kind
parent than I have been. I was happy till this
hour in the thought that I was hastening home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
to England to return my thanks to my benefactor,
to see my dear child, and receive her at his hands—and
now alas this happy, this blessed, prospect
is blighted by the melancholy intelligence of this
good man’s death, and would to heaven that this
were the worst—but the most painful intelligence
is yet to be added. I am informed from the best
authority that my poor dear child has been simple
enough to be captivated by a young man of high
rank, who is too vain to love any one but himself,
and too proud to marry beneath his own
rank. I am, therefore, likely to be greeted with
sorrows and perplexities on my very return to
England.”</p>

<p>The elder stranger sighed calmly; and as it
were resignedly, when he had finished speaking.
The younger one looked thoughtful and sighed
also. A pause of some minutes’ silence followed,
and the young man said:</p>

<p>“You must hope better things, sir; a long
absence from home should indeed always prepare
us for something of change and calamity; we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
must look for those fluctuations of humanity:
but still we may be permitted to hope, and to
enjoy pleasing thoughts as long as possible.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, your remarks are very true, but they
are not so easily applied. Hope does not come
and go at the command of reason, and the
spirits do not rise and fall according to the dictates
of the understanding, or by any force of
ratiocination. I ought to apologise for troubling
you, a stranger, with my sorrows; they cannot
be interesting to you; but it is not easy when
the heart is full to prevent it from overflowing.”</p>

<p>“No apology, sir, is necessary: or, if it were,
I might adopt the language of your apology, and
use it as a preface to my tale of sorrow and disappointment
awaiting me also at my return to
my native land. I have also cause for grief.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, one so young as you appear to be!
But yours, young man, are the sorrows, perhaps,
of a youthful lover. Yours are not so deeply
rooted as mine.”</p>

<p>These words led to an explanation which told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
the two strangers that their concerns were more
nearly allied than they had been aware. Our
readers of course need not be informed that the
elder of the two was Mr Primrose, and the
younger Mr Robert Darnley. They were happy,
however, in the midst of their sorrows, to have
become thus acquainted at a distance from home.
They only regretted that the distance between
their respective situations in India had formed an
insuperable barrier against an acquaintance and
intimacy there. The fact is that, so long as Dr
Greendale considered the return of Mr Primrose
as a matter of uncertainty, he had been very
cautious of exciting his daughter’s expectations.
He had ventured to consider his own
approbation quite sufficient to allow of the correspondence
between his niece and Mr Robert
Darnley, and had in his letters to Mr Primrose
simply mentioned the fact without stating particulars,
thinking that it would be time enough
hereafter, should the mutual affection of the
young persons for each other continue and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
strengthen. Mr Primrose had, in reply to that
information, left Dr Greendale quite at liberty to
make such disposal of Penelope as he might
think proper; for the father was well aware that
the uncle was, both by discretion and affection,
well qualified for the guardianship of his child.</p>

<p>The vessels in which the two gentlemen sailed
soon weighed anchor and put to sea again. So
the friends were parted for a time; nor did they
hold any farther communication on the course of
their voyage, for they had not left St Helena
many days before the ship parted company in a
gale of wind. That vessel in which Mr Primrose
sailed first arrived in England, as we have already
intimated.</p>

</div>


<p>England appeared to Mr Primrose quite a new
world. He had sixteen years ago sailed down
the river Thames, which presented on its banks
at that time quite as much picturesque beauty as
now. But he did not then observe these beauties.
His heart was full of other thoughts, and
his mind was moved by widely different feelings.
There had not been in his soul the sentiment of
moral beauty, nor was there in his heart that
repose of pleasure which could admit of enjoying
the external world in its manifestations of beauty
or sublimity. But on his return homewards his
thoughts were far different. He had left England
in forlorn hope, but he was returning under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
brighter auspices. He had sailed from his native
land, bearing a deeply felt burden of self-reproach;
and though he could not forget or forgive his
former self, and though still there were painful
scenes to be witnessed, and melancholy information
to be received, yet the aspect of things was
widely different from what it had been at his
departure. And he expressed himself delighted
with all that he saw. The little boats and the
lighter craft upon the river spoke of bustle and
activity, and of human interest; and in them he
saw the flutterings of business and prosperity.
Though it was winter, and the trees on the rising
grounds were leafless, and the fields had lost their
greenness, yet the very pattern and outline of
what the scene had been in summer, and of what
it would be again in spring, were all very charming
to his eye, then active with imagination. His
own bright thoughts gave verdure to the trees
and greenness to the fields; and he thought that
England indeed was a blessed land. And as the
vessel made her way up the river, and as at a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
distance a dense black cloud was seen, he knew
that that was a manifestation of their vicinity
to the great city, and that dark mass of floating
smoke, which rustic eloquence so glibly reprobates,
was to his soul a great refreshment and a
most pleasing sight.</p>

<p>As soon as he disembarked, he first directed
his steps to the office of his agent in the city,
to make enquiry respecting the speediest mode of
arriving at Smatterton: for he knew not that his
daughter’s residence was now in London. There
is a great contrast between the appearance of the
banks of the Thames and the inside of a city
counting-house; but they are both very pleasant
sights to those who are glad to see them. Mr
Primrose was indeed very glad to see his native
land, and to walk the streets of its busy metropolis;
and with very great cordiality did he shake
hands with the principal in the office, and very
politely did the principal congratulate him on his
return to England. Mr Primrose did not notice
the great contrast between his own joy-expanded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
face and the business-looking aspect of the
agent; but he thought that all London looked as
glad to see him as he was to see London. After
transacting at the office of his agent such
business as was immediately important, and
without waiting to observe what changes and
improvements had taken place in the great city
since he had left it sixteen years ago, he made
enquiry after the readiest and quickest mode of
reaching Smatterton, and finding that the stage-coach
was the most rapid conveyance, he immediately
directed his steps thitherward.</p>

<p>There are in the course of human life many
strange and singular coincidences. Now it happened
that the very day on which Mr Primrose
was preparing to start for Smatterton, Mr Kipperson
also was going to travel the same road, and
by the same conveyance. Little did the former
imagine that he was going away from his daughter;
little did he think that, in his way to the White
Horse cellar in Piccadilly, he had actually passed
the house in which his beloved child and only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
hope lay sick and ill. The days in December are
very short; and it was nearly dark when, at four
o’clock in the afternoon, Mr Primrose and Mr
Kipperson, unknown to each other, took their
seats in the coach. They had the inside of the
coach to themselves.</p>

<p>Mr Primrose, as we have said, was in good
spirits. He certainly had some cause for grief,
and some source of concern; but the feeling of
satisfaction was most prominent. He had shed
tears to the memory of Dr Greendale, and he
hoped that the worthy man had so instructed the
dependent one committed to his care, that no
permanent cause of uneasiness would be found in
her. The intelligence which he had received
respecting her alleged and supposed fickleness
came from Mr Darnley, and the father, therefore,
knowing Mr Darnley to be a very severe and rigid
kind of man, and withal mighty positive, hoped
that a premature judgment had been formed, and
trusted that, when all was explained, all would
be right. We must indeed do the father of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
Penelope the justice to say that, with all his
failings, he was sincere, candid, and downright.
He never suffered any misunderstanding to exist
where it could possibly be cleared up. He was
plain and direct in all his conduct.</p>

<p>We need not say that Mr Kipperson was in
good spirits. He always was so. He was so
very happy that by this last journey to London
he had saved the nation from being starved to
death by a superabundance of corn. What a
fine thing it is to be the cleverest man in the
kingdom! What would become of us all were it
not for such men as Mr Kipperson starting up
about once in a century, or twice a-week, to
rectify all the errors of all the rest of the world?
And what is the use of all the world beside, but
to admire the wisdom of such men as Mr Kipperson?
Our only fear is that we may have
too many such profoundly wise men; and the
consequence of an over supply of wisdom would
be to ruin the nation by folly.</p>

<p>Whether Mr Kipperson addressed Mr Primrose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
or Mr Primrose addressed Mr Kipperson, we
know not; but in a very short time they became
mighty good friends. To some observation of
Mr Primrose, his fellow traveller replied:</p>

<p>“You have been abroad I suppose, sir?”</p>

<p>“I have, sir,” said Mr Primrose; “and that
for a long while: it is now upwards of sixteen
years since I left England, and I am most happy
to return to it. Many changes have taken place
since I went abroad, and some, I hope, for the
better.”</p>

<p>“Many improvements have indeed been made
in the course of that time. We have improved,
for instance, in the rapidity with which we travel;
our roads are as smooth as a bowling-green.
But our greatest improvements of all are our
intellectual improvements. We have made wonderful
strides in the march of intellect. England
is now the first country in the world for all that
relates to science and art. The cultivation of
the understanding has advanced most astonishingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span></p>

<p>“I remember noticing when I was in India,”
said Mr Primrose, “that the number of publications
seemed much increased. But many of
them appeared to be merely light reading.”</p>

<p>“Very likely, sir; but we have not merely
light reading; we have a most abundant supply
of scientific publications: and these are read
with the utmost avidity by all classes of people,
especially by the lower classes. You have no
doubt heard of the formation of the mechanics’
institutes?”</p>

<p>“I have, sir,” replied Mr Primrose; “but I
am not quite aware of the precise nature of their
constitution, or the object at which they aim.
Perhaps you can inform me?”</p>

<p>“That I can, sir,” said Mr Kipperson; “and
I shall have great pleasure in so doing; for to
tell you the truth I am a very zealous promoter
of these institutions. The object of these institutions
is to give an opportunity to artisans, who
are employed all day in manual labour, to acquire
a scientific knowledge, not only of the art by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
which he lives and at which he works, but of
everything else which can possibly be known or
become a subject of human inquiry or interest.”</p>

<p>“But surely,” interrupted Mr Primrose, “it is
not designed to convert mechanical into scientific
men. That seems to my view rather a contradiction
to the general order of things.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” replied the other; “you
are repeating, I perceive, exploded objections.
Is it possible, do you think, that a man should
do his work worse for understanding something
of the philosophy of it? Is it not far better,
where it is practicable, that a man should act as
a rational reflecting creature, than as a piece of
mere machinery?”</p>

<p>“Very true, certainly, sir; you are right. Ay,
ay, now I see: you instruct all artisans in the
philosophy of their several employments. Most
excellent. Then, I suppose, you teach architecture
and read lectures on Vitruvius to journey-men
bricklayers?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>“Nay, nay, sir,” replied Mr Kipperson, “we
do not carry it quite so far as that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I beg your pardon,” replied Mr Primrose,
“I had not the slightest idea that this was
carrying your system too far. It might, perhaps,
be a little refinement on the scheme to suppose
that you would teach tailors anatomy; but after
all I do not see why you should start at carrying
a matter of this kind too far. The poet says,
‘a little knowledge is a dangerous thing;’ and,
for my own part, I can see no great liberality in
this parsimonious and stinted mode of dealing
out knowledge; for unless you teach the lower
classes all that is to be taught, you make, or
more properly speaking keep up, the distinction.”</p>

<p>Mr Kipperson was not best pleased with these
remarks; he saw that his fellow-traveller was one
of those narrow-minded aristocratic people, who
are desirous of keeping the mass of the people
in gross ignorance, in order that they may be
the more easily governed and imposed upon.
Though in good truth it has been said, that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
ignorant are not so easily governed as the enlightened.
The ingenious and learned Mr Kipperson
then replied:</p>

<p>“You may say what you please, sir, in disparagement
of the system of enlightening the
public mind; but surely you must allow that it
is far better for a poor industrious mechanic to
attend some lecture on a subject of science or
philosophy, than to spend his evenings in drunkenness
and intemperance.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, sir, I have no wish to disparage the
system of enlightening the public mind; and I
am quite of your opinion, that it is much more
desirable that a labouring man”——</p>

<p>“Operative, if you please,” said Mr Kipperson;
“we have no labouring men.”</p>

<p>“Well,” pursued Mr Primrose, “operative;
the term used to be labouring or working when I
was last in England: I will agree with you, sir,
that it is really better that an operative should
study philosophy, than that he should drink an
inordinate quantity of beer. But do you find,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
sir, that your system does absolutely and actually
produce such effects?”</p>

<p>“Do we?” exclaimed Mr Kipperson triumphantly:
“That we certainly and clearly do: it is
clear to demonstration; for, since the establishment
of mechanics’ institutes, the excise has
fallen off very considerably. And what can that
deficiency be owing to, if it be not to the fact
which I have stated, that the operatives find
philosophy a far more agreeable recreation after
labour than drinking strong beer?”</p>

<p>“You may be right, sir, and I have no doubt
you are; but, as I have been so long out of
England, it is not to be wondered at that my
ideas have not been able to keep pace with the
rapid strides which education has made in England
during that time. I am very far from wishing
to throw any objection or obstacle in the way
of human improvement. You call these establishments
‘mechanics’ institutions:’ but pray,
sir, do you not allow any but mechanics to enjoy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
the benefit of them? Now there is a very numerous
class of men, and women too—for I should
think that so enlightened an age would not
exclude women from the acquisition of knowledge;—there
is, I say, a very numerous class of
men and women who have much leisure and little
learning—I mean the servants of the nobility
and gentry at the west end of the town. It
would be charitable to instruct them also in the
sciences. How pleasant it must be now for the
coachman and footman, who are waiting at the
door of a house for their master and mistress, at
or after midnight, instead of sleeping on the
carriage, or swearing and blaspheming as they
too frequently do, to have a knowledge of astronomy,
and study the movements of the planets.
Is there no provision made for these poor
people?”</p>

<p>“Certainly there is,” said Mr Kipperson.
“There are cheap publications which treat of all
the arts and sciences, so that for the small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
charge of sixpence, a gentleman’s coachman may,
in the course of a fortnight, become acquainted
with all the Newtonian theory.”</p>

<p>Mr Primrose was delighted and astonished at
what Mr Kipperson told him; he could hardly
believe his senses; he began to imagine that he
must himself be the most ignorant and uninformed
person in his majesty’s dominions.</p>

<p>“But tell me, sir,” continued he, “if those persons,
whose time and attention is of necessity so
much occupied, are become so well informed; do
others, who have greater leisure, keep pace with
them; or, I should say, do they keep as much
in the advance as their leisure and opportunity
allow them? For, according to your account, the
very poorest of the community are better instructed
now than were the gentry when I lived
in England.”</p>

<p>“Education, sir,” answered Mr Kipperson,
with the tone of an oracle, “is altogether upon
the advance. The science of instruction has
reached a point of perfection, which was never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
anticipated; nay, I may say, we are astonished
at ourselves. The time is now arrived when the
only ignorant and uninformed persons are those
who have had the misfortune to be educated at
our public schools and universities: for in them
there is no improvement. I have myself been
witness of the most shocking and egregious ignorance
in those men who call themselves masters
of arts. They know nothing in the world about
agriculture, architecture, botany, ship building,
navigation, ornithology, political economy, icthyology,
zoology, or any of the ten thousand
sciences with which all the rest of the world
is intimate. I have actually heard an Oxford
student, as he called himself, when looking over
a manufactory at Birmingham, ask such questions
as shewed that he was totally ignorant even of
the very first rudiments of button-making.”</p>

<p>“Astonishing ignorance,” exclaimed Mr Primrose,
who was rather sleepy; “I dare say they
make it a rule to teach nothing but ignorance at
the two universities.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span></p>

<p>“I believe you are right, sir,” said Mr Kipperson,
rubbing his hands with cold and extacy;
“those universities have been a dead weight on
the country for centuries, but their inanity and
weakness will be exposed, and the whole system
exploded. There is not a common boys’ school
in the kingdom which does not teach ten times
more useful knowledge than both the universities
put together, and all the public schools into the
bargain. Why, sir, if you send a boy to school
now, he does not spend, as he did formerly, ten
or twelve years in learning the Latin grammar,
but now he learns Latin and Greek, and French,
German, Spanish, Italian, dancing, drawing,
music, mapping, the use of the globes, chemistry,
history, botany, mechanics, hydrostatics, hydraulics,
hydrodynamics, astronomy, geology, gymnastics,
architecture, engineering, ballooning, and
many more useful and indispensable arts and
sciences, so that he is fitted for any station in
life, from a prime minister down to a shoe-black.”</p>

<p>Before this speech was finished, Mr Primrose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
was fast asleep; but short is the sleep in a coach
that travels by night. The coach stopped and
woke our foreigner from a frightful dream. We
do not wish to terrify our readers, but we must
relate the dream in consequence of its singularity.
He dreamed then, that he was in the island of
Laputa, and that having provoked the indignation
of some of the learned professors by expressing
a doubt as to the practicability of some of their
schemes, he was sentenced to be buried alive
under a pyramid of encyclopedias. Just as the
cruel people were putting the sentence into
execution, he woke and found his coat-collar
almost in his mouth, and heard the word ‘ology’
from the lips of his fellow traveller. He was
very glad to find that matters were no worse.</p>

</div>


<p>Few indeed are the adventures now to be met
with in travelling by a stage coach, and few also,
comparatively speaking, the accidents. But our
travellers were destined to meet both with accident
and adventure. The coach, as our observant
readers have noticed, must necessarily have
travelled all night. The nights in December are
long and dark; and not unfrequently, during the
long cold silence of a December night, there
gently falls upon the dank surface of the earth a
protecting and embellishing fleece of flaky snow.
And the morning snow as yet untrodden has a
brilliant and even cheerful look beneath a blue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
and brightly frosty sky; and when a wide expanse
of country variegated with venerably-aged
trees, and new enclosures and old open meadow
lands, and adorned with here and there a mansion
surrounded with its appurtenances of larch, pine,
and poplar, and divided into unequal but gracefully
undulating sections by means of a quiet
stream—when a scene like this bursts upon the
morning eye of a winter traveller, and shows
itself set off and adorned with a mantle of virgin
snow, it is indeed a sight well worth looking at.
Mr Primrose had not seen snow for sixteen years,
and the very sight of it warmed his heart; for it
was so much like home. It was one of those
natural peculiarities which distinguished the land
of his birth from the land of his exile. He expressed
to his fellow traveller the delight which
he felt at the sight. Mr Kipperson coincided
with him that the view was fine, and proposed
that, as they were both well clad, and as the
scenery was very magnificent, they should by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
way of a little variety seat themselves on the
outside of the coach. The proposal was readily
embraced, and they mounted the roof.</p>

<p>The carriage was proceeding at a tolerably
rapid pace on high but level ground; and the
travellers enjoyed the brightness of the morning,
and the beauty of the valley which lay on their
left hand. Shortly they arrived at a steep descent
which led into the valley beneath, and there
was no slacking of pace or locking of wheels,
which had been customary in going down hill
when Mr Primrose was last in England. He expressed,
therefore, his surprise at the boldness
or carelessness of the coachman, and hinted that
he was fearful lest some accident might happen.
But Mr Kipperson immediately dissipated his
fears, by telling him that this was the usual practice
now, and that the construction of stage-coaches,
and the art of driving, were so much
improved, that it was now considered a far safer
and better plan to proceed in the usual pace
down hill as well as upon level ground. Mr Kipperson,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
in short, had just proved to a demonstration
that it was impossible that any accident
could happen, when down fell one of the horses,
and presently after down fell coach and all its
company together.</p>

<p>Happily no lives were lost by the accident.
But if Mr Kipperson’s neck was not broken by
the fall, his heart was almost broken by the flat
contradiction which the prostrate carriage gave
to his theory, and he lay as one bereft of life.
Equally still and silent lay Mr Primrose; for he
was under the awkward difficulty of either denying
his fellow traveller’s correctness or doubting
the testimony of his own senses. The catastrophe
took place near to a turnpike house; so
that those of the passengers, who had experienced
any injury from the overturning of the
coach, could be speedily accommodated with all
needful assistance. All the passengers, however,
except Mr Primrose, were perfectly able, when
the coach was put to rights again, to resume
their journey. Mr Primrose, as soon as he recovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
from the first shock of his fall, was
very glad to take refuge in the turnpike house,
and he soon became sensible that it would not
be prudent for him then to pursue his journey.
He had indeed received a severe shock from the
accident, and though he had no bones broken he
had suffered a violent concussion which might be
doctored into an illness.</p>

<p>As soon as possible medical assistance was
procured. The surgeon examined and interrogated
the overturned gentleman with great diligence
and sagacity. From the examination, it
appeared not unlikely that the patient might
promise himself the pleasure of a speedy removal.
The truth of the matter was, that the poor gentleman
was more frightened than hurt. Some
cases there are, and this was one of them, in
which no time should be lost in sending for the
doctor, seeing that, if the doctor be not sent
for immediately, he may not be wanted at all.
This is one of the reasons why physicians
keep carriages, and have their horses always in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
readiness; for by using great expedition they
frequently manage to arrive before the patient
recovers.</p>

<p>The surgeon who attended Mr Primrose thought
proper to take some blood from his patient, and
to supply the place of the same by as many
draughts as could be conveniently taken, or be
reasonably given in the time. It was also recommended
that the gentleman should be put to
bed.</p>

<p>The dwellings attached to turnpike gates are
seldom so roomy and so abundantly provided
with accommodation as to admit of an accidental
visitor: but in the present case it so happened
that there was an apartment unoccupied and not
unfurnished. The gatekeeper’s wife, who was a
notable and motherly kind of woman, said, that
if the gentleman could put up with a very small
apartment, and a coarse but clean bed, he might
be accommodated, and he need not fear that the
bed was damp, for it had been occupied for the
last month, and had only been vacated the day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
before. Mr Primrose readily accepted the offer,
not being very particular as to appearance.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said he, “you keep a spare bed
for the accommodation of those who may be
overturned in coming down this hill? Your surgeon,
I find, does not live far off. That is a good
contrivance. Pray can you tell me, within a
dozen or two, how many broken bones the stage
coach supplies him with in the course of the
year?”</p>

<p>At this speech the good woman laughed, for it
was uttered in such a tone as intimated that the
gentleman wished it to be laughed at; and as
he was a respectable looking man, and carried
in his aspect a promise to pay, the worthy wife
of the gate-keeper laughed with right good will.</p>

<p>“Oh dear no, sir,” said she, “there is not an
accident happens here hardly ever. The coachman
what overturned you this morning, is one of
the most carefullest men in the world, only he
had a new horse as didn’t know the road.”</p>

<p>“A very great comfort is that,” said Mr Primrose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
and he smiled, and the gate-keeper’s wife
smiled, and she thought Mr Primrose a very
funny man, that he should be able to joke when
under the doctor’s hands. There are some people
who are very facetious when they are sick,
provided the sickness be not very acute; for it
looks like heroism to laugh amidst pain and
trouble.</p>

<p>Mr Primrose then proceeded; “So you will
assure me that the person who occupied your
spare bed last, was not an overturned coach
passenger?”</p>

<p>The poor woman did not smile at this observation,
but on the contrary looked very grave,
and her eyes seemed to be filling with tears,
when she compressed her lips and shook her
head mournfully. With some effort, after a
momentary silence, she said:</p>

<p>“No, sir, it was not any one that was overturned;
but it was a coach passenger. It was a
young lady, poor dear soul! that seemed almost
dying of a broken heart. But had not you better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
go to bed, sir? The doctor said you wanted
rest.”</p>

<p>Mr Primrose was a nervous man, and tales of
sorrow inartificially told frequently depressed
him, and excited his sympathy with greater
force than was consistent with poetical enjoyment.
He therefore took the considerate advice
which the good woman gave him, and retired to
rest. To a person of such temperament as Mr
Primrose, the very mention of a young lady
almost dying of a broken heart was quite sufficient
to set his imagination most painfully at
work. Rapidly did his thoughts run over the
various causes of broken hearts. Very angry did
he become with those hardened ones, by whose
follies and vices so many of the gentler sex suffer
the acutest pangs of the spirit. He thought of
his own dear and only child, and he almost
wrought himself up to a fever by the imagination
that some villanous coxcomb might have trifled
with her affections, and have left her to the
mockery of the world. He then thought of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
mother of his Penelope, and that she had died of
a broken heart, and that his follies had brought
her to an untimely grave. Then came there into
his mind thoughts of retributive justice, and
there was an indescribable apprehension in his
soul that the sorrows which he had occasioned to
another might fall also to his own lot. He wondered
that there should be in the world so much
cruelty, and such a wanton sporting with each
others’ sufferings. The powerful emotions which
had been raised in his mind from the first hour
that he embarked for England, were of a nature
so mingled, and in their movements so rapid,
that he hardly knew whether they were pleasurable
or painful. There was so much pleasure
in the pain, and so much pain in the pleasure,
that his mind was rendered quite unsteady by a
constant whirl and vortex of emotions. He felt
a kind of childish vivacity and womanly sensibility.
His tears and his smiles were equally
involuntary; he had no power over them, and
he had scarcely notice of their approach. Something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
of this was natural to him; but present
circumstances more strongly and powerfully
developed this characteristic. The accident,
from which he had received so sudden a shock,
tended still farther to increase the excitability of
his mind. When therefore he retired for the
purpose of gaining a little rest, his solitude
opened a wider door to imagination and recollection;
and thereupon a confused multitude of
images of the past, and of fancies for the future,
came rushing in upon him, and his mind was
like a feather in a storm.</p>

<p>The surgeon was very attentive to his patient,
for he made a second visit not above four hours
after the first. The people at the turnpike-house
told him that the gentleman had, in pursuance
of the advice given him, retired to take a little
rest. The medical man commended that movement;
but being desirous to see how his patient
rested, he opened the door of the apartment very
gently, and Mr Primrose, who was wide awake,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
and happy to see any one to whom he could talk,
called aloud to the surgeon to walk in.</p>

<p>“I am not asleep, sir; you may come in; I am
very glad to see you; I have felt very much
relieved by the bleeding. I think I shall be quite
well enough to proceed to-morrow. Pray, sir,
can you inform me how far it is to Smatterton
from this place?”</p>

<p>“About sixty miles,” replied the surgeon.</p>

<p>“Sixty miles!” echoed Mr Primrose; “at
what a prodigious rate then we must have
travelled.” Thereupon the patient raised himself
up in the bed, and began, or attempted to begin,
a long conversation with his doctor. “Why,
sir, when I was in England last, the coach
used to be nearly twice as long on the road. Is
this the usual rate of travelling?”</p>

<p>The medical man smiled, and said, “The coach
by which you travelled, is by no means a quick
one, some coaches on this road travel much
faster.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span></p>

<p>“And pray, sir, do these coaches ever arrive
safely at their journey’s end?”</p>

<p>The surgeon smiled again and said, “Oh yes,
sir, accidents are very rare.”</p>

<p>“Then I wish,” replied Mr Primrose; “that
they had not indulged me with so great a rarity
just on my arrival in England. I have been in
the East Indies for the last sixteen or seventeen
years, and during that time—”</p>

<p>Few medical men whose business is worth
following, have time to listen to the history of a
man’s life and adventures for sixteen or seventeen
years. Hindoostan is certainly a very interesting
country, but there is no country on the face of
the earth so interesting as a man’s own cupboard.
The doctor therefore cut off his patient’s speech,
not in the midst, but at the very beginning;
saying unto him, with a smile, for there is much
meaning in a smile; “Yes sir, certainly sir, there
is no doubt of it—very true; but, sir, I think
it will be better for you at present to be kept
quiet; and if you can get a little sleep it will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
better for you. I think, sir, to-morrow, or the
next day, you may venture to proceed on your
journey. I will send you a composing draught
as soon as I return home, and will see you again
to-morrow, early in the morning. But I would
not recommend you to travel by the stage
coach.”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, thank you for that recommendation,
and you may take my word I will follow it.”</p>

<p>The doctor very quickly took his leave, and
Mr Primrose thought him a very unmannerly
cub, because he would not stop to talk. “A composing
draught!” thus soliloquized the patient;
“a composing draught! a composing fiddlestick!
What does the fellow mean by keeping me thus
in bed and sending me in his villanous compounds.
Why, I think I am almost able to walk
to Smatterton. I won’t take his composing
draught; I’ll leave it here for the next coach
passenger that may be overturned at the foot of
this hill. I dare to say it will not spoil with
keeping.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></p>

<p>The word “coach-passenger” brought to Mr
Primrose’s recollection the melancholy look and
sorrowful tone of the poor woman who mentioned
the young lady who seemed almost dying of a
broken heart. His curiosity was roused, his
nerves were agitated. He kept thinking of his
poor Penelope. He recollected with an almost
painful vividness the features and voice of the
pretty little innocent he had left behind him
when he quitted England. He recollected and
painted with imagination’s strongest lines and
most glowing colours that distracting and heart-rending
scene, when after listening with tearful
silence to the kind admonitions of his brother-in-law,
he snatched up in his arms his dear little
laughing Penelope, and he saw again as pungently
as in reality, the little arms that clasped
him with an eagerness of joy, and he recollected
how his poor dear child in the simplicity of her
heart mistook the agitations and tremblings of
grief for the frolicsome wantonness of joy, and
he saw again that indescribably exquisite expression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
with which she first caught sight of his
tears; and then there came over his mind the
impression produced by the artless manner in
which the poor thing said, “Good night, papa,
perhaps you won’t cry to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Now he thought of that Penelope as grown up
to woman’s estate, and he felt that he should
be proud of his daughter: but oh what fears
and misgivings came upon him, and he kept muttering
to himself the words of the woman who
had talked of the young lady almost dying of a
broken heart. It was well for the patient that
the doctor soon fulfilled his word and sent a
composing draught. But the very moment that
his attentive nurse gently tapped at the door of
his room, he called out:</p>

<p>“Come in, come in, I am not asleep. Oh,
what you have brought me a composing draught!
Nonsense, nonsense, keep it for the next coach-passenger
that is overturned, and give it to him
with my compliments. Well, but I say, good
woman, you were telling me something about a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
poor young lady who was almost dying with a
broken heart. Who is she? Where is she? What
is her name? Where is she gone to? Where did
she come from? Who broke her heart? Was she
married, or was she single? Now tell me all
about her.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear, sir, I am sure you had better take
this physic what the doctor has sent you, that
will do you more good than a mallancolly story.
Indeed you’d better, sir; shall I pour it out into
a cup?”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, pour it out. But I say, good
woman, tell me where did this poor young lady
come from?”</p>

<p>“Lord, sir, I never saw such a curious gentleman
in my life. Why, then if you must know,
she came from a long way off, from a village of
the name of Smatterton, a little village where
my Lord Smatterton has a fine castle.”</p>

<p>While the good woman was speaking she
kept her eyes fixed upon the cup into which she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
was slowly pouring the medicine, and therefore
she did not perceive the effect produced upon
the patient by the mention of Smatterton; for, as
soon as he heard the name he started, turned
pale, and was breathless and speechless for a
moment; and then recovering the use of his
speech, he exclaimed, “Smatterton! Smatterton!
Good woman, are you in your senses? What do
you mean?”</p>

<p>Now it was very well for Mr Primrose and his
composing draught that the wife of the gate-keeper
was not nervous; for had she been nervous,
that sudden and almost ridiculous exclamation,
uttered as it was, in a very high key, and with
a very loud voice, would certainly have upset the
cup together with its contents. If ever a composing
draught was necessary, it clearly was so
on this occasion. The good woman however did
not let the cup fall, but with the utmost composure
looked at the patient and said:</p>

<p>“Lawk-a-mercy, sir, don’t be in such a taking.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
I durst to say the poor cretter wasn’t nobody as
you know. She was a kind of a poor young
lady like. There now, sir, pray do take your
physic, ’cause you’ll never get well if you don’t.”</p>

<p>Mr Primrose was still in great agitation, and
that more from imagination than apprehension.
His nervous sensibility had been excited, and
everything that at all touched his feelings did
most deeply move him. He therefore answered
the poor woman in a hurried manner:</p>

<p>“Come, come, good woman, I will swallow
the medicine, if you will have the goodness to
tell me all you know about this poor young
lady.”</p>

<p>Now, as it was very little that the good
woman did know, she thought it might be for
the patient’s advantage if he would take the
medicine even upon those terms. For she had
so much respect for the skill of the doctor, that
it was her firm opinion that the draught would
have more power in composing, than her slender
narrative in disturbing, the gentleman’s mind.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
She very calmly then handed the cup and said:
“Well, sir, then if you will but take the physic,
I will tell you all I know about the matter.”</p>

<p>Mr Primrose complied with the condition, and
took the medicine with so much eagerness, that
he seemed as if he were about to swallow cup
and all.</p>

<p>“There, sir,” said the good woman, mightily
pleased at her own management; “now I hope
you will soon get better.”</p>

<p>“Well, now I have taken my medicine; so
tell me all you know about this young lady.”</p>

<p>“Why, sir, ’tisn’t much as I know: only,
about two months ago, that coach what you
came by was going up to town, and it stopped,
as it always does, at our gate, and the coachman
says to my husband, says he, ‘Here’s a poor
young lady in the coach so ill that she cannot
travel any farther; can you take her in for a
day or two?’ And so I went and handed the
poor thing out of the coach, and I put her to
bed; and sure enough, poor thing, she was very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
ill. Then, sir, I sent for the doctor; but, dear
me, he could do her no good: and so then I
used to go and talk to the poor cretter, and all
she would say to me was, ‘Pray, let me die.’
But in a few days she grew a little better, and
began to talk about continuing her journey, and
I found out, sir, that the poor dear lady was
broken-hearted.”</p>

<p>Here the narrator paused. But hitherto no
definite information had been conveyed to Mr
Primrose, and he almost repented that he had
taken the trouble to swallow the medicine for
such a meagre narrative.</p>

<p>“And is that all you know, good woman?
Did not you learn her name?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the informant: “her name was
Fitzpatrick: and after she was gone, I asked the
coachman who brought her, and he told me that
that wicked young nobleman, Lord Spoonbill,
had taken the poor thing away from her friends,
and had promised to make a fine lady of her,
but afterwards deserted her and sent her about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
her business. And all because my lord was
mighty sweet upon another young lady what
lives at Smatterton.”</p>

<p>Now came the truth into Mr Primrose’s mind,
and he readily knew that this other young lady
was his Penelope. This corroborated the letter
which Mr Darnley had written to him on the
decease of Dr Greendale. Happy was it for the
father of Penelope that he had no suspicion of
unworthy intentions towards his daughter on the
part of Lord Spoonbill; and well was it for the
traveller that he had swallowed the composing
draught. He received the information with
tolerable calmness, and thanking the poor
woman for indulging his curiosity, he very
quietly dismissed her. And as soon as she was
gone he muttered to himself:</p>

<p>“My child shall never marry a villain, though
he may be a nobleman.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
</div>


<p>Whether it was that the medicine which
Mr Primrose had taken possessed extraordinary
composing powers, or whether his mind had
been quieted by its own outrageous agitations,
we cannot say; but to whatever cause it might be
owing, it is a fact that, on the following morning
he was much more composed, and the medical
attendant pronounced that he might without any
danger proceed on his journey.</p>

<p>He was not slow in availing himself of this
permission, and he also followed the suggestion
of his medical attendant in not travelling by the
stage-coach. After astonishing the gate-keeper
and his wife, and also the doctor, by his liberality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
for their attention to him, he started in a post-chaise
for Smatterton. No accident or interruption
impeded his progress, and at a late hour
he arrived at Neverden, intending to pay his first
visit to Mr Darnley, and designing through him
to communicate to Penelope the knowledge of
his arrival, and prepare her for the meeting.</p>

<p>It was necessary for Mr Primrose to introduce
himself to Mr Darnley. The stately rector of
Neverden was in his study. He was not much
of a reading man, he never had been; but still
it was necessary that he should keep up appearances,
and therefore he occasionally shut himself
up in that room which he called his study;
and there he would read for an hour or two some
papers of the Spectator, or some old numbers
of the Gentleman’s Magazine, or Blackstone’s
Commentaries, or any other book of equal reputation
for sound principles. There is a great
advantage in reading those books that everybody
talks about and nobody reads. It was also very
proper that, if any of the parishioners called on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
the rector, it might be necessary to send for him
“out of the study.” Sometimes also Mr Darnley
gave audiences in his study, and then the unlearned
agriculturists thought him a most wonderful
man to have so many books, and so many
large books too; some of them looking as big
as the great bible in the church. Mr Darnley
was not at all displeased to see the eyes of
his humble parishioners, when they made their
appearance in that apartment, wandering curiously
and modestly round the room, and leering
at the great glass bookcases and the eighteen-inch
globes with as much wonderment as the
gulls of two centuries back used to look at the
dried alligators in a conjuror’s garret. How delicious
is the sensation of superiority.</p>

<p>When the name of Primrose was mentioned,
Mr Darnley thought for a moment only of Penelope,
and he screwed up his lips and looked
wondrously wise. Mr Primrose entered the
room with a light and lively step, and with a
bright and cheerful countenance, taking it for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
granted that everybody in England must be
as glad to see him as he was to see his
native land again. Mr Darnley rose with great
stateliness, and advanced a step or two towards
the door.</p>

<p>“Ah! Mr Darnley, your most humble servant;
my name is Primrose, I received a letter
from you about six weeks ago, which you did
me the honor to write to me concerning the
death of my poor brother Greendale.”</p>

<p>At the end of the sentence Mr Primrose
spoke in a more subdued tone, as became him
when speaking of the death of a dear friend.
But as he spoke he offered his hand to the
rector of Neverden, who in return offered his,
but it was by no means an equivalent; for
the reverend divine gave his hand so formally
and indifferently, that it was to Mr Primrose
as cold and flabby as a duck’s foot. And he
said, “Mr Primrose, I am happy to see you.
You are welcome to England.” But though
he said he was happy, he did not look so,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
unless it be true, as some philosophers have
averred, that happiness is the most serious
thing in the world. The rector of Neverden
also said, “I beg you will be seated, sir.”
He had learned that from the Right Honorable
the Earl of Smatterton; for no man is so
great a simpleton that nothing can be learned
from him.</p>

<p>There was nothing uncivil or rude in this
reception, what could be more proper or polite
than to welcome Mr Primrose to England, and
ask him to be seated? But Mr Primrose felt
a chill at this reception. However, he sat
down; and then the polite rector, when his
visitor was seated, sat down also. Then he
snuffed the candles, and carefully closed the
book that he had been reading, and pushed
it some distance from him, even so far as his
arm could reach, and then he turned himself
in his chair from the table, and towards Mr
Primrose, and looked at him as much as to
say, “What do you want with me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span></p>

<p>Mr Primrose interpreted the look, and said
“I have never had the pleasure of seeing you
before Mr Darnley, except for a very few
minutes, and at some distance of time; but
as you wrote to me an account of my dear
brother’s death, and as I have now returned
to England, and am expecting presently the
happiness of a meeting with my dear child,
I thought it might be advisable to call first
on you, that some message may be sent to
Penelope, that the surprise may not be too
much for her.”</p>

<p>“Miss Primrose,” said the imperturbable
rector of Neverden, “is not at present in this
part of the country.”</p>

<p>The effect of the composing draught was
completely gone off, and Mr Primrose started
up from the chair to which he had been so
politely invited, and exclaimed with great impetuosity,
“Good God! Mr Darnley, you don’t
say so.”</p>

<p>Mr Darnley was not so much agitated as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
Mr Primrose, and therefore he compressed his
lips and knitted his brows, and then opened
his mouth and said very composedly: “Mr
Primrose, I beg that you would recollect that
I am a clergyman, and therefore that it is not
becoming and correct, that in my presence, you
should take the name of the Lord in vain.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said Mr Primrose,
with tears in his eyes, “but consider, sir, I
am a father, and—”</p>

<p>“I also am a father,” interrupted the rector,
“and have more children than you have.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but tell me, tell me, sir, is my child
living?”</p>

<p>“To the best of my knowledge Miss Primrose
is living.”</p>

<p>“But where is she? Why has she left Smatterton?”</p>

<p>“I believe, sir, that Miss Primrose is in
London, that is all that I know of her, except—”
Here the rector hesitated, as if
reluctant and fearful to say all that he knew.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
If composure of manner be at all contagious,
Mr Primrose was the last person in the world
to catch the contagion; for at this dry hesitation
he became more violent, and exclaimed
with great earnestness:</p>

<p>“Mr Darnley, you are a man, and must
have the feelings of humanity. I implore and
conjure you by all that is sacred to put me
out of this dreadful state of suspense, and tell
me at once all you know of my poor child;
something you must know and you ought to
know.”</p>

<p>There was an energy of utterance and a
heart-reaching tone in this last sentence, which
staggered Mr Darnley’s cold formality and discomposed
his stateliness. The almost awful
emphasis which Mr Primrose gave to the expression,
“you ought to know,” reminded Mr
Darnley that he had but imperfectly performed
his duty to the niece of his old friend Dr
Greendale; and the strong feeling thus expressed
compelled the pompous man to something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
of more kindly thought and language.
He rose from his seat, and took Mr Primrose
by the hand, and said to him:</p>

<p>“My good sir, pray compose yourself, be
seated, and I will give you all the information
in my power. Your daughter is living,
and is, I believe, in health. You know, I presume,
that there formerly was something of an
acquaintance between Miss Primrose and my
son, and you also know, as I learn by a letter
from my son, who had the honor of meeting
you at St Helena, that this acquaintance has
ceased.”</p>

<p>“I know it, Mr Darnley, and I am sorry
for it, very sorry for it indeed, especially from
what I have since heard of that young gentleman
who is said to be paying attention
to her.”</p>

<p>Mr Darnley here shook his head, and then
proceeded.</p>

<p>“After the decease of my good friend and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
neighbour Dr Greendale, before I knew that
the correspondence had ceased between the
young folks, I offered Miss Primrose an asylum
in my house.”</p>

<p>Here Mr Darnley paused for a compliment;
he had learned that of the Right Honorable
the Earl of Smatterton. Mr Primrose paid him
the proper compliment on his liberality, and
the worthy rector continued his narrative.</p>

<p>“Miss Primrose was pleased to decline the
offer on the ground that the Countess of Smatterton
had taken upon herself to provide for
her. And it is not many days since Miss Primrose
left Smatterton for London, where she now
is, in the house of Lord Smatterton, and she
honored us with a call before her departure,
and I took the liberty of giving her the best
advice in my power, to guard her against the
snares and dangers to which she might be exposed
in that profession which she is about
to adopt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span></p>

<p>“Profession she is about to adopt! Mr Darnley.
And may I ask what that profession is?”</p>

<p>“The musical profession, Mr Primrose.”</p>

<p>The father of Penelope was indignant, and
he replied contemptuously: “Impossible! Can
the patronage of the Countess do nothing better
for my child than make her a teacher of
music. But there will be no necessity now—”</p>

<p>Before Mr Primrose could finish the sentence,
Mr Darnley corrected the misapprehension and
said: “Not a teacher of music, sir, but a
public singer.”</p>

<p>This made the matter worse, and the poor
man was just ready to burst out into violent exclamations
again, but recollecting that it was in
his power now to place his child in a situation
of independence, and considering that the time
of her departure from Smatterton had been too
recent to render it likely that she had yet
appeared in public, he contented himself with
saying, “I am astonished that the Countess
should think of such a profession for a young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
woman brought up as my child has been. If
my poor brother-in-law had lived he would
never have suffered it.”</p>

<p>“I was also astonished,” said Mr Darnley,
“that Miss Primrose should give her consent
to such a proposal; for my friend Dr Greendale
used to express himself very strongly on
that subject, and endeavour to dissuade Miss
Primrose from adopting such a profession. It
has long been the wish of the Countess of
Smatterton, but her ladyship did not succeed
in the proposal during the lifetime of Dr
Greendale.”</p>

<p>Much more to the same purpose did Mr
Darnley say on the subject, not much to the
satisfaction of Mr Primrose. It is not pleasant
for a father to hear anything to the discredit
of a child, but fortunately parents do not always
believe such stories, or they find excuses which
nobody else can. So Mr Primrose did not,
could not, and would not believe the insinuation
that Mr Darnley threw out against Penelope,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
as if she had waited only for Dr Greendale’s
decease to adopt a profession against
which he had serious objections; and Mr Primrose
thought it most probable that the Countess
of Smatterton had used great importunity,
or that Penelope had complied, to relieve Mrs
Greendale of a burden. There was indeed some
difficulty in his mind to reconcile this story of
Mr Darnley with the insinuation thrown out
in his letter, and corroborated by the poor
woman at the turnpike-gate, concerning the son
of the Earl of Smatterton having withdrawn
the affections of Penelope from Robert Darnley
to himself. But Mr Primrose had been
out of England many years; and fashions had
changed since he left his native land. It was
perhaps now quite elegant and fashionable to
appear on the stage. He recollected that when
he was at school, he had read of Nero, the
Roman emperor, appearing on the stage as a
public performer, and for aught that could be
known to Mr Primrose, the progress of refinement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
in England might have pointed out dramatic
or musical exhibition as a fit introduction
to the honor of an alliance with nobility.</p>

<p>At all events, whatever were his notions or
apprehensions he was by this time considerably
more calm and composed. He had the satisfaction
of knowing that his daughter was alive and
well, and he had the pleasing prospect of speedily
seeing her again. Of her moral and mental
qualities, and of her intellectual improvement,
he had been in the constant habit of receiving
flattering and agreeable accounts, and he was
not unwilling to believe them. There was some
little mortification, that he had travelled so far
and all to no purpose. But he had no other
means of ascertaining where his daughter was.</p>

<p>It was a conceit of his own, (though partly
aided by his late brother-in-law,) not to keep any
direct correspondence with his daughter. His
motive was, that as there was a possibility that
he might never return to England, and that he
might not ever have it in his power to provide for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
her according to his former means, therefore he
thought it best not to excite any expectations
which might be frustrated, or to excite in her
mind any interest concerning himself, which
might ultimately be productive of only pain and
uneasiness. He wished his poor child to consider
herself an orphan, thinking it better to surprise
her with a living parent than to inflict grief
on her mind at the thoughts of one deceased.</p>

<p>This scheme did not entirely succeed. The
worthy and benevolent rector of Smatterton could
not help now and then saying a favourable word
or two concerning his poor brother Primrose;
and as Dr Greendale’s was the charity that
hopeth all things and believeth all things, he
was not distrustful of his brother’s promises, but
was nearly, if not altogether, as sanguine as Mr
Primrose himself. By degrees Penelope came
to have an interest in her absent parent; and well
it was for her that Dr Greendale had thus accustomed
her to think of her father: for when the
good rector departed this life he did not leave his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
niece quite so orphaned as if she had had no
knowledge or thought of her absent father. But
to proceed with our story.</p>

<p>We have said that it was late in the evening
when Mr Primrose arrived at Neverden. It was
no great distance indeed to Smatterton; but
why should he go there in any hurry, seeing that
his daughter was not there? This consideration
induced Mr Darnley to offer to the traveller the
accommodation of a bed: for Mr Darnley was
not a churlish man; he was only very cold, and
very formal, and very pompous. The offer was
readily accepted, and the rector of Neverden then
conducted Mr Primrose from the study to the
apartment in which the family was sitting. Great
curiosity was excited as soon as Mr Darnley
announced the name of his late arrived guest.
The young ladies felt particularly interested in
looking at the father of Penelope; but they did
not make themselves, as they thought, quite so
agreeable as they should have done had matters
been proceeding in proper order with respect to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
their brother and Penelope. The absence of that
species of agreeableness to which we allude, was
no great inconvenience to Mr Primrose; for he
was weary with travelling, and exhausted by manifold
agitations, and it would not have been very
agreeable to him with all this exhaustion to
undergo a cheerful volley of everlasting interrogations;
and Miss Mary Darnley would to a
certainty have extorted from him a civil, ecclesiastical,
statistical, botanical, and zoological, history
of British India, to say nothing of Persia,
China, Japan, and the million isles of the Eastern
ocean.</p>

<p>But though the young ladies were not disposed
to apply the question to Mr Primrose,
their mother, who was as ready to forgive as she
was apt to forget, talked to him as cordially and
cheerfully as if the day had been fixed for the
marriage of Robert Darnley and Penelope Primrose.
Her talk, however, was not wearying,
because there was no affectation in it, and because
there was much good feeling in it. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
talk was concerning her dear boy; and Mr Primrose,
who had a parent’s heart, enjoyed such
talk.</p>

<p>“And so, Mr Primrose, you have seen my
dear Robert? And how did he look? He is
dying to return to Neverden. We expect him
next week, for the ship is now in the Downs.
Did you think, sir, he seemed in good health?”</p>

<p>“In perfect health, madam: in fact I never
saw a young man who had been so long in India
look so well as your son.”</p>

<p>“There was no yellowness in his look?” asked
Mrs Darnley.</p>

<p>“Not the slightest, I can assure Mrs Darnley.”</p>

<p>“And was he not much sun-burnt?”</p>

<p>Mr Primrose smiled, and said, “Not any more,
madam, than a young man ought to be; and
though I never had the pleasure of seeing the
young gentleman before, I do really believe that
whatever darkness may have been added to his
complexion is rather an improvement to his appearance
than otherwise.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span></p>

<p>“I am ashamed, Mr Primrose, to be so troublesome;
but did you go aboard his ship when
you were at St Helena? Do you know what
sort of accommodations he had?”</p>

<p>“I certainly did not, madam, but I have every
reason to suppose that he had every comfort that
could be expected.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, no doubt. But still it must be a
great confinement. It is a very long voyage.
Had you any storms, sir, as you came home?”</p>

<p>“Upon my word, Mrs Darnley, I really forget
what kind of weather we had; but we had nothing
very serious, or I should have remembered
it.”</p>

<p>With many such-like questions and answers
was the evening beguiled, and it was late before
Mr Primrose retired to rest.</p>

<p>The young ladies took some part in the conversation,
though but little; and Mr Darnley
himself also now and then joined in the discourse,
especially when Mrs Darnley, in the simplicity
of her heart, asked questions which indicated a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
sinful ignorance of geography or history. In
such cases Mr Darnley took especial care to
manifest how much wiser he was than his wife.
Positively it is a great shame, and altogether unreasonable
to expect that people who have been
from school thirty years or more should be as
wise and learned as those who have just finished
their education, or as those who have a study
where they can sit and read and grow learned
every hour in the day.</p>

<p>When the young ladies were alone they made
amends for their previous silence. They all
talked together to one another concerning Mr
Primrose, and all three gave their opinions of
him. By the way, it is great nonsense to talk
about giving an opinion. It is almost as bad as
giving advice; for neither one nor the other is
ever taken, and how can any one give that which
nobody takes? There was, however, this unanimity
among the Miss Darnleys; they all concurred
in saying and thinking that he was a very
agreeable and interesting man, and a very lively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
man. They would indeed have thought him
lively had they witnessed the energy of his
manner in the study with Mr Darnley. But
before the discussion closed, Miss Mary Darnley
could not help saying: “What strange questions
mamma did ask! I wonder what Mr Primrose
thought of her?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
</div>


<p>Without the assistance of a composing draught
Mr Primrose slept soundly and woke calmly.
But, being naturally impetuous and hasty, he
could not help uttering a few monosyllables of
impatience at the thought that he had travelled
two hundred miles from his daughter, and had
incurred the risk of breaking his neck in making
a journey to the place where his daughter was
not.</p>

<p>As, however, he was so near Smatterton, he
would not of course return to London without
seeing Mrs Greendale, and thanking her for the
kind attention which she had paid to Penelope.
He was not aware that the good lady had plagued
and worried the poor girl almost out of her life.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
Dr Greendale had never, in his communications to
Mr Primrose, said anything about the annoying
fidgettiness of Mrs Greendale; and he himself,
by virtue of his close and constant application
to study, had not felt much inconvenience from
her temper, excepting so far as an occasional interruption,
which was soon forgotten. But poor
Penelope did not study controversial theology,
and therefore she had felt all the inconvenience
of Mrs Greendale’s humours and caprices. Of
all this Mr Primrose knew nothing; he therefore
resolved to call and pay his respects to the
widow.</p>

<p>Having learned a lesson of forethought from
his long fruitless journey, he did not proceed to
Smatterton before he had enquired of Mr Darnley
if Mrs Greendale yet resided there. By this enquiry
he learned that the living had been disposed
of, and that as the new rector was a young and
single man, and though he had taken possession
of the rectory-house, he had been kind enough
to accommodate Mrs Greendale with a residence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
there till it might suit her to change the place
of her abode. “That is very kind of the young
man,” said Mr Primrose; “I like him for it: and
pray what is his name and where does he come
from?”</p>

<p>Mr Darnley at these questions put on one of
his stately professional looks, and said: “His
name, sir, is Pringle, he comes from the university
of Oxford, he is a son of Lord Smatterton’s
steward. At present I have but little acquaintance
with him.”</p>

<p>There seemed, from Mr Darnley’s manner of
speaking, to be on his part no great desire to
increase the acquaintance. Of this, however,
Mr Primrose took no notice; in fact, he hardly
understood it, for his own manner was straitforward
and downright, he did not accustom himself
to innuendos and insinuations. Thanking
the rector of Neverden for his attention and
hospitality, Mr Primrose proceeded immediately
after breakfast to the village of Smatterton.
Mrs Greendale was within, and she received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
Mr Primrose with the utmost cordiality
and cheerfulness: but when she began to allude
to her poor dear husband then the tears came
into her eyes. Mr Primrose sympathized with
her, and they both talked of old times; and as
the subject was changed the tears were dried up.
It was very right that Mrs Greendale should most
cordially receive Mr Primrose, for all persons
who come home from the East Indies in good
spirits are supposed to come home rich, and
there is to some minds something very agreeable
in the sight of a rich man. Let sentimentality-people
prose as much as they please about the
homage that is paid to wealth; it would be much
worse if that homage were paid to poverty. The
conversation then turned to Penelope, and many
and sincere were the thanks that Mr Primrose returned
to Mrs Greendale for her very kind attentions
to the poor girl; and then Mrs Greendale,
in spite of all the severe and sneering rebukes,
which in former days she had lavished upon her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
niece, began to launch out into commendations
of the young lady’s beauty, wit, and accomplishments.</p>

<p>“But what a pity it is, Mr Primrose, that you
did not know that Penelope was in London.
Well, you will have such a treat in seeing her
again, she is so grown and so improved. She is
a favorite with everybody. A day or two before
my poor dear husband died, we had a party, and
Lord Spoonbill, and Colonel Crop, and Miss
Spoonbill were all here; and Lord Spoonbill was
so attentive, you can’t think. Then my Lady
Smatterton has taken such a fancy to her, that
she insists upon having her in London.”</p>

<p>“Ay, but Mrs Greendale, I don’t understand
the condition on which my child is thus taken
up to London; and to tell you the truth, I do
not altogether approve the plan which Mr
Darnley informed me was in contemplation. It
is not very agreeable to my feelings that my
daughter should be made a public performer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span></p>

<p>“Oh dear no, certainly; but I dare say the
Countess of Smatterton would not recommend
anything improper.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what may be Lady Smatterton’s
notions of propriety, but I shall take care that
my daughter does not adopt that or any other
profession.”</p>

<p>While they were talking, the arrival of Nick
Muggins with the letter-bag reminded Mr Primrose
that it might be desirable to apprize Penelope
of his being in England and of his intention
of immediately seeing her. He therefore dispatched
a note to his daughter, under cover to
the Right Honorable the Earl of Smatterton,
and thus he made wise provision against further
accidents preventing their meeting.</p>

<p>As Mr Primrose had experienced the inconvenience
of one overturn by the stage-coach, he
determined not to trust himself again so soon to
the same mode of conveyance; and as he intended
to travel post, and as he was not about
to set out immediately, he amused himself with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
strolling about the village to admire its beauties;
for everybody said that Smatterton was a very
pretty village. In the month of December English
scenery seldom appears to great advantage;
and while Mr Primrose was looking for, rather
than at, the beauties of Smatterton, who should
he meet but the very identical Mr Kipperson with
whom he had travelled in the stage-coach? The
parties recognized each other immediately, and
they presently entered into chat. Mr Kipperson
expressed great concern for the accident, but
was exceedingly rejoiced to find that his fellow-traveller
was not seriously hurt. “For indeed,
sir,” said he, “I almost thought that you were
killed.”</p>

<p>“So did I,” replied Mr Primrose: “but what
can be the use of travelling at that unreasonably
rapid rate? When I was in England, sixteen
years ago, the stage-coaches used to go at a very
reasonable and moderate pace.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I remember it,” said Mr Kipperson;
“but we should never be able to get on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
with business were it not for this quick travelling.
I will tell you, sir, an instance of its
utility: the other day I received a letter from
my friend the Earl of Smatterton, informing me
of an important debate which was just coming
on, and it was a matter of infinite moment that
I should be in town in order to attend some
meetings that were to be held, and to give
my opinion concerning some clauses which were
likely to be introduced greatly affecting the agricultural
interest. I received the letter just in
time to take advantage of the coach, and, by
means of quick travelling, I arrived in town time
enough to give my views of the subject, and to
prevent the passing of some most destructive
measures.”</p>

<p>“You are a member of parliament, I presume?”
said Mr Primrose.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Mr Kipperson, with that sort
of air that seemed to indicate that he did not at
all desire that honor, and that he was a person of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
greater importance; “but now and then parliament
is pleased to do me the honor of consulting
me on some topics connected with the interests
of agriculture.”</p>

<p>Though Mr Primrose was what in ordinary
language is called an independent man, yet he
could not but feel reverence for greatness; and
finding that the gentleman with whom he was
conversing was a person of some consequence,
he was desirous of knowing who it was. This
desire was but slightly hinted, and immediately
the great agricultural luminary gratified Mr
Primrose’s laudable thirst after knowledge by
saying: “My name, sir, is Kipperson. Kipperson,
sir, of Smatterton.”</p>

<p>It was very excusable that Mr Primrose, who
had been so many years out of England, should
not be familiar with the name, and should not
be aware that he was addressing the celebrated
agriculturist, Kipperson of Smatterton. Mr
Kipperson himself was so modest a man that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
he did not choose to say that he was the celebrated
one of that name, but he took especial
care to let it be understood indirectly and circuitously
that he was a person of some importance
in the world.</p>

<p>And now it was very natural that the great
agriculturist should be desirous of knowing the
name and designation of his fellow traveller, and
to ascertain that was also no great difficulty.
As soon as he found that he was conversing with
the father of Penelope Primrose, he broke out
into the most eloquent panegyrics on the character,
moral, intellectual, and professional, of the
late rector of the parish, and congratulated Mr
Primrose in having had the good fortune to confide
his daughter to the care of so superlatively
excellent a man. “But, sir,” as suddenly recollecting
himself, “perhaps you will do me the
honor to walk in and sit down under my humble
roof; for I can give you the latest information
concerning Miss Primrose. It is very singular
that I should have travelled up to London with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
the daughter and down from London with the
father.”</p>

<p>At that singularity, or at his own penetration
in discovering the curious coincidence, Mr Kipperson
smiled. Mr Primrose accepted the invitation
and walked into Mr Kipperson’s house,
which was near the place where they had met.
It was a piece of affectation in Mr Kipperson to
call his place of abode a humble roof. True, it
was not so magnificent as Smatterton castle, but
its owner had been at great pains and expense
to make it look quite the reverse of humble.
That which had been a productive little garden
was converted into a lawn. Those barns, piggeries,
and outhouses, in which was deposited
no small part of the owner’s wealth, had been
gracefully, but ungratefully, planted out. French
windows supplied the place of old-fashioned casements,
and green verandahs gave Peter Kipperson’s
farm-house as much as possible the air of
an Oriental palace.</p>

<p>Mr Primrose was surprised, as Peter hoped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
and designed, at the very learned air of the
library, to say nothing of the numerous busts
and casts which in the narrow entrance occupied
that room which would have been much more
usefully devoted to cloak-pegs. When they were
seated in the library Mr Kipperson commenced
his narrative, telling Mr Primrose what the
reader is already acquainted with. But still
the father of Penelope was not reconciled even
to the attempt or proposal to make his daughter
a public singer. Mr Kipperson however
assured him, that nothing could be more respectable
than the manner in which the Countess
of Smatterton designed to bring out Miss
Primrose.</p>

<p>“I was present at an evening party,” said
the agriculturist, “given by my friend the
Countess of Smatterton, for the express purpose
of introducing Miss Primrose to some of
the best society in town. There were several
persons of rank there, and among the rest the
celebrated Duchess of Steeple Bumstead; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
her Grace was quite enraptured with Miss
Primrose.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the father of Penelope with
some shortness and dryness of manner, “I
don’t understand these matters. I have been
so long out of England that I almost forget
the customs of my native land; but I do not
approve of this kind of association with persons
of so much higher rank and fortune.
The Countess of Smatterton cannot consider
my daughter as an equal, and therefore she
is tolerated for the amusement she can afford.
I don’t like it, sir, I don’t like it. But, Mr
Kipperson, can you tell me what kind of a
man is Lord Spoonbill?”</p>

<p>Mr Kipperson promptly replied: “A man of
no intellect whatever.”</p>

<p>“A fig for intellect,” replied Mr Primrose;
“but is he a man of good character?”</p>

<p>“Indeed sir,” responded the great agriculturist
of Smatterton, “I am sorry to say he
is not. The Earl himself is a very respectable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
man, so far as moral conduct is concerned,
though he is a man of no mind; and
he is a proud man, very distant and pompous,
and quite an exclusive.”</p>

<p>“An exclusive!” echoed Mr Primrose; “what
is meant by an exclusive?”</p>

<p>“By exclusive, sir, I mean that the Earl is
not easily led to associate with those whom he
considers of an inferior rank to himself; he is one
of a set, as it were.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is that all!” exclaimed Mr Primrose;
“why at that rate all the world is exclusive.
This is no new character though it may be a
new name.”</p>

<p>“Very true, indeed, very true, there has
always been too much pride among persons of
high rank.”</p>

<p>“And not too little among persons of low
rank, I presume,” replied Mr Primrose; “and I
suppose as you have a set of people in England,
called exclusives, you have most likely another
set called intrusives. For my part I like a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
pride, or at least what the world calls pride; I
have so much myself, that I dislike the situation
in which I find my daughter is placed, and I
shall make all haste to remove her from it. I
am most happy that I have arrived in England
time enough to prevent her from making a public
display of her musical talents.”</p>

<p>The wise and scientific Mr Kipperson was not
sorry to hear that the father of Penelope
Primrose could talk thus boldly and definitely
concerning his daughter’s independence. It was
also not unpleasant to him to hear that it was
the intention of the young lady’s father to
remove her from the house and patronage of the
Earl of Smatterton. It has been already hinted
that Mr Kipperson was an admirer of the young
lady, and it was not likely that his admiration
should be less when he found that her father
had returned to England in possession, most probably,
of ample means of securing his daughter’s
independence. This consideration inspired the
agriculturist with an earnest desire of making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
himself more agreeable than usual; and as there
was a great deal of freedom of manner and candour
of feeling about Mr Primrose, he very
readily and sociably conversed with Mr Kipperson
on any and every topic that could be
started. In the fullness of his heart the admirer
of Penelope urged the young lady’s father to
partake of a humble dinner, quite in a social
friendly way. This invitation however was of
necessity declined, it being the intention of Mr
Primrose to pass the remainder of the day at the
rectory.</p>

<p>The mention of the rectory led Mr Kipperson
to speak of the new rector, the Rev. Charles
Pringle. “You will of course meet this gentleman
at dinner. He is a very different man from
our late rector; as yet we know little of him. I
have conversed with him occasionally; he seems
to have very just notions on the subject of the
interests of agriculture; but his mind does not
appear to be comprehensive and philosophical;
he does not read much, I think; indeed, he has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
scarcely any books of his own, and though I
have offered him the use of my library he does
not avail himself of it. But you will see him at
the rectory at dinner, and then you may form
your own opinion of him.”</p>

<p>It was very kind and liberal of Mr Kipperson
to give Mr Primrose leave to form his own
opinion of the new rector. What opinion Mr
Primrose did form of the new rector we cannot
say, for he was not very free in expressing his
opinion of those with whom he had no common
interest or sympathies, nor was he particularly
and curiously observant to ascertain whether
those with whom he conversed occasionally
were persons of comprehensive and philosophical
minds or not. He was not quite sure that he
knew what was meant by the term <i>comprehensive</i>,
as applied to the mind; and as to <i>philosophical</i>,
if that meant loving wisdom, he himself was
philosophical enough in all conscience, for he
liked wise men much better than fools. In a
word, the father of Penelope had quite as good an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
understanding as multitudes who make a great
deal of prating about intellect, but he was not a
man of much reading, and did not value pedantry
of any kind, whether literary, scientific, fashionable
or philosophical.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
</div>


<p>Even as Mr Kipperson predicted so it came to
pass; Mr Primrose met at dinner the new rector
of Smatterton.</p>

<p>The great difference which there is between an
old man and a young one, is one cause of the
general common-place notion of the deterioration
of the human species. It seemed a very great
transition from Dr Greendale to Mr Pringle.
The doctor used to be grave, sedate, yet cheerful,
very placid and gentle in his manner, and towards
his parishioners he wore the aspect of a
father. His dress too was so venerable. He used
to wear a long single-breasted coat, and he had
such fine broad old-fashioned silver buckles at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
his knees and on his shoes; his hat too was just
such a hat as a clergyman ought to wear. And
when he walked out into the village he always
carried under his arm an old gold-headed walking
cane; for he seldom leant upon it. He walked
slowly and demurely, and when the little boys
and girls who met him planted themselves, according
to their clumsy but sincere politeness,
directly before him to make their bow or curtesy,
he patted them on the head, and they felt themselves
as much honoured and pleased as the
alderman of some provincial borough when the
king places the sword on his shoulder. And when
the old people met him he talked to them, and,
even more than that, he listened to their talk; he
could not always understand it, but he paid attention
to it and it pleased them. Sometimes
he would be in a gayer and livelier mood than
usual, especially if in his morning studies he
had been successful in detecting, or eloquent in
pointing, some irrefragable argument against the
sectarians. And then, if he met any young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
woman of pretty and smiling looks, for there
were many such in Smatterton, he would ask
her when she was going to be married, and then
she would laugh and try to blush, and she would
go home and tell her mother what a funny man
Dr Greendale was.</p>

<p>Now whatever might be the virtues, moral or
professional, of the Rev. Charles Pringle, it is
very clear that he could not find the way to the
hearts of his parishioners by the same means as
his predecessor. A slightly built youth of five-and-twenty
would look anything but venerable,
if dressed in attire of the same form, cut and
complexion as that which Dr Greendale wore.
The gold-headed cane, the looped hat, the slow
and stately walk, would not at all answer with a
young man; and had he asked any young
woman when she was going to be married, it
would have been thought quite indecorous. The
old women too would not think of telling a
young man round-about stories concerning their
sufferings with the <i>rheumatiz</i>, or other ills that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
“flesh,” or more properly skin and bone, may
be “heir to.”</p>

<p>It was therefore essential and unavoidable that
there should be a difference between the old and
the new rector. It will however be supposed
by our readers, who remember that we have
described the Earl of Smatterton as boasting
that he always bestowed his livings according to
merit,—it will be supposed, that the Rev. Charles
Pringle had merit, though not precisely of the
same nature as the merit of Dr Greendale. The
merit for which his lordship bestowed the living
of Smatterton on Mr Pringle, was not his own
merit but that of his father. For the young
rector was, as already noticed, the son of Lord
Smatterton’s house-steward. This steward had
been faithful in his office, and was a great
favorite with his lordship; but though he was
faithful he had saved a little money, and was
desirous of setting his son forward in life. The
father was of opinion that the legal profession
would suit the young man very well, seeing he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
was so very clever. The son also was perfectly
well aware of his own cleverness; but as the
confinement of an attorney’s office did not suit
his inclinations, he excused himself from that
pursuit. On the same or similar ground he
declined the medical profession, inasmuch as it
was contrary to his notions of comfort to be
called from his bed at midnight, or to be interrupted
at his meals. The church seemed to be
the only comfortable profession, and on that the
young gentleman fixed his choice. Moreover it
gratified his vanity to go to college. He might
have had ambition, but he did not like trouble;
and being, as we have said, a clever young man,
he shewed his cleverness by studying only just
so much as might save him from being plucked.
He obtained his degree and that was all. With
equal dexterity and cleverness did he manage
that reading which was necessary preparatory to
taking orders. The examining chaplain who
passed him, observed that he was a clever man,
for he had most ingeniously hit upon the exact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
<i>minimum</i> of information which would enable
him to pass. There is a proverb, which says
that lazy folks take the most pains; and in many
cases Mr Pringle illustrated this proverb, for
nobody could take more pains than he did to
avoid labour.</p>

<p>We cannot see how the Earl of Smatterton
was to blame for appointing this young gentleman
to the living of Smatterton. It is not to be
supposed that his lordship should take the
trouble to examine the youth; and as the father
was a faithful servant the Earl was rewarding
merit by providing for the son.</p>

<p>More remains to be said concerning the new
rector. He was a man of good temper and very
harmless disposition. He was not at all given to
quarrelling, for he did not like the trouble; and he
was very easy to deal with in fixing the composition
for his tithes. The farmers thought him rather
proud; for he took very little notice of any of
them except Mr Kipperson, who kept an excellent
table. He paid great attention to Miss Spoonbill,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
though his only recompense for that attention
was an occasional cup of tea, and that by
no means strong: but it was handed to him on
a large silver waiter, and presented by a servant
who wore a very splendid livery. There was
much courtesy of manner in Mr Pringle; he
was, according to the best of his ability, a perfect
gentleman, and whenever he observed any article
of dress, or mode of expression or pronunciation,
or any species of action peculiar to persons in
high life, he copied it most faithfully as far as his
profession would allow. His courtesy was very
great, for he had the sagacity to know that, if
he was too lazy to provide for himself, he must
persuade some one else to provide for him.</p>

<p>One word more, and that concerning the
young man’s politics. The world does not
much care about Mr Pringle’s politics, but still
the politics of a clergyman looking for preferment
are to himself matters of great moment.
Before Mr Charles Pringle went to Oxford, he
was what is called liberal in his politics; at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
Oxford he found it more genteel to be a Tory;
but under the patronage of a great Whig lord, it
was a matter of course that he should regard
the Whig aristocracy with reverence and approbation.</p>

<p>We should not have said so much of Mr
Pringle, had it not been that he had once seen
Penelope Primrose and greatly admired her, and
had it not also been that the return of Mr Primrose
to England rendered it a very promising
speculation for the young gentleman to think
seriously of paying his addresses to her.</p>

<p>When Mr Primrose first called at the rectory
the reverend divine was not visible, for he had
not finished the duties of the toilet. But hearing
that Mr Primrose was in England and at
Smatterton, he felt most happy in an opportunity
of paying his respects. And such was the
candour of Mr Primrose, that he thought the
new rector a very agreeable sensible man. The
two gentlemen at dinner-time talked with great
fluency on a variety of topics which neither of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
them understood or cared about. Now Mr Primrose
was at this time in that state of mind which
prepared and disposed him to be easily pleased,
and therefore the efforts of Mr Pringle to make
himself agreeable succeeded to admiration.
Quite delighted was the rector of Smatterton to
hear the father of Penelope express himself so
well pleased with that village as to be desirous
of taking up his residence there. Very politely
did the reverend gentleman remark that there
was no house in the village fit for Mr Primrose’s
reception. Mr Primrose however observed that
he was by no means particular, and that a mere
cottage would answer his purpose. Mr Pringle
thought that he should have no objection to
giving up the parsonage and finding a residence
for himself, and there was some little talk to
that purpose, but nothing was definitely agreed
upon.</p>

<p>As the two gentlemen were engaged in chat
about everything and nothing, a very unexpected
interruption was given to their conversation by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
the entrance of Robert Darnley. He had arrived
at Neverden much sooner than he had been
expected, and hearing that Mr Primrose had
been there on the preceding day, and was now
in all probability at Smatterton, he determined,
notwithstanding all persuasions to the contrary,
to ride over and see the father of Penelope.
The young gentleman’s sisters were unanimous in
expressing their disapprobation of such a step;
and Mr Darnley the elder would have interfered
with the pompousness of authority to prevent it,
had he not been sagacious enough to know that
such interference would be ineffectual, and wise
enough to consider that it is very impolitic to
endanger one’s dignity by uttering commands
which will with impunity be disobeyed. He
could not however help giving his opinion. He
was surprised, he said, that a young man of such
good sense and independent spirit as Robert
Darnley should let himself down so far as to
turn suppliant. The young lady, he observed,
had already given abundant manifestation of the
change of her mind and the indifferency of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
feelings on the subject, it would therefore be
worse than useless to attempt to renew the
acquaintance, it would be absolutely humiliating,
and there never could subsist a right
feeling of cordiality between them.</p>

<p>All this talk, however, had no influence on
Robert Darnley: he was not sure that there had
been so pointed a manifestation of change of
mind; he had too good an opinion of Penelope’s
understanding to believe that she should have
capriciously changed her mind; he thought it
very probable that there might have been some
miscarriage of letters; and he resolved that he
would not suffer the matter to rest in the present
dubious and mysterious twilight of information.
For he very thoughtfully remarked, that
it was possible there might be, through the irregular
transmission of letters, some errors which
might lead Miss Primrose to consider him as
the person dropping the acquaintance. At all
events, as he had never had any difference with
Mr Primrose, but, on the contrary, had been
very civilly and politely treated when they met<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
at St Helena on their voyage home, it would
be but an act of common civility to pay his
respects to the father of Penelope now that he
was in the immediate neighbourhood.</p>

<p>There is something pleasant and refreshing in
the contemplation of that wholesome state of
mind in which Robert Darnley shewed himself to
be on the present occasion. People sometimes
make a great blustering and a noisy parade about
demanding an explanation; but they generally
set about this demanding an explanation in such
a hot-headed, bullying style, as to render explanation
almost impossible, and make that which
is perplexed still more perplexed. It was not so
with the younger Darnley. He was no miracle
either of wisdom or virtue; but he had good
sense and good feeling; and he also had a tolerable
good opinion of his own discernment, and
he could not easily bring himself to believe, notwithstanding
all that had been said by his father
and his sisters, that he had misapprehended or
overrated the character of Penelope Primrose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span></p>

<p>These feelings, which were habitual and constitutional
to Robert Darnley, gave him a natural
and easy cheerfulness of look and manner. When
therefore he was announced at the rectory of
Smatterton as enquiring for Mr Primrose, the
announcement was received with great satisfaction.</p>

<p>“My good friend,” exclaimed Mr Primrose,
with much cordiality, “I am most happy to see
you. So you are just arrived in England. But
you must have made very great haste to arrive
here from the Downs in little more than four and
twenty hours.”</p>

<p>“I have not travelled quite so rapidly as that,
sir,” replied Mr Robert Darnley, “but you may
suppose I lost no time: and I am happy that I
am here soon enough to pay my respects to you
before your return. It would also have given me
pleasure could I have met Miss Primrose.”</p>

<p>“Would it indeed? What! after she has jilted
you? You are a young man of very forgiving
disposition.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span></p>

<p>“I must first of all know for a certainty that
the lady has, as you say, jilted me, before I feel
resentment. The correspondence was interrupted,
but that might be accidental. I must have an
explanation, then it will be time enough to be
angry.”</p>

<p>“Well said, young man; I like your notions.
But from what I hear, both at Neverden and
Smatterton, I fear that my young lady has been
fascinated by a sounding title. I hear a great
deal that I cannot well understand. If travellers
see strange things abroad, they also hear strange
things when they come home again.”</p>

<p>Mr Primrose ceased speaking. Robert Darnley
looked thoughtful; and the parties looked at
each other with some feeling of perplexity. The
father of Penelope, as being the most impetuous,
though by far the oldest of the two, after a short
interval continued: “But what do you propose
to do? Or what must I say or do for you? Will
you set off with me to London tomorrow morning?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span></p>

<p>Robert Darnley looked serious at that proposal,
and replied: “So early as tomorrow morning,
under present circumstances, I think hardly praticable.
I do not know what would be the consequence
to my poor mother, if, after so long
an absence from home, I should omit, just at
my return, to eat my Christmas dinner with her.”</p>

<p>“Well, I shall go to town,” said Mr Primrose,
“and I will endeavour to ascertain the truth of
the matter; and if there has been any accidental
loss of letters, it will be a great pity to make
that the cause of breaking off an old acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“I simply wish it, sir, to be understood by
Miss Primrose, that the cessation of the correspondence
has not been my act and deed. But
that I wrote three letters to her from Calcutta,
to none of which I have ever received any answer.
If the acquaintance is to be discontinued, it shall
not rest on me, as arising from any fickleness on
my part.”</p>

<p>“Good, sir, very good. You are a comparative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
stranger to me, it is true; but I commend your
spirit, that you are not hasty in resentment
before you know for what. And this I can tell
you,” continued he, in a more slow and serious
tone, “such was my thorough confidence in the
good sense and discernment of my poor brother
Greendale, that I cannot but feel respect for
any one whom he respected; and I know that he
respected you most sincerely.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the two gentlemen, with cordial
grasp and tearful eyes, shook each other by the
hand most heartily, and parted very well pleased
with each other.</p>

</div>


<p>Mr Primrose on the following morning set off
for London in a post-chaise, being unwilling to
risk his neck a second time in a stage-coach; for
he had taken it into his head that a stage-coach
must be overturned at the bottom of a steep hill.
He travelled alone; and we will for the present
leave him alone; though it might be very entertaining
to observe how pettishly he brooked the
tediousness of that mode of travelling, and how
teasing he was to the post-boys, sometimes urging
them to drive fast, and then rebuking them
for using their horses so cruelly. What the poor
man could find to amuse himself with for the
long journey, which occupied him nearly three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
days, we cannot tell. In the meantime, we find it
necessary to return to that part of our narrative
in which we related that the partial exhibition to
which Penelope had been exposed at the Countess
of Smatterton’s select little party, had produced
an almost serious illness.</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the kind attentions of
the Countess. Every hour was she making enquiries,
and all that could possibly be said or
done by way of alleviation or consolation did
her ladyship say and do for her heart-broken
patient. It never for one single moment entered
the mind of Lady Smatterton that Miss Primrose
could feel the slightest repugnance in the
world to the profession which had been chosen
for her; nor could her ladyship think that any
sorrow or deep feeling was on the mind of Penelope
for the death of her uncle, or that there
was any harassing anxiety on her spirits at the
thought of her father’s probable arrival in England.
The Countess of Smatterton might have been a
woman of very great feeling; but, from difference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
of situation, she could not by any means sympathize
with Penelope. There is an infinite difference
between five hundred acquaintances and an
only dear friend. The pleasures of Penelope were
not of the same nature as those of the Countess
of Smatterton, nor was there much similarity in
their pains.</p>

<p>There were also other considerations by which
it may be accounted for, that the sympathy of
her ladyship was not exactly adapted to the
feelings of Penelope. The Countess was a patron,
Penelope a dependent. The Countess had
but the mere vanity of rank, Penelope a natural
and essential pride of spirit; and it not unfrequently
happens, that persons in the higher
walks of society regard the rest of the world as
made to be subservient to their caprices and the
instruments of their will. This last consideration,
however, is not altogether the fault of the higher
classes; much of it, perhaps most of it, is owing
to the hungry venal sycophancy of their inferiors,—but
there never will be an act of parliament<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
passed against servility, and therefore we need
not waste our time in declaiming against it, for
nothing but an act of parliament can thoroughly
cure it.</p>

<p>Penelope was not sufficiently ill to keep her
apartment for any great length of time. The
medical attendant thought it desirable that the
patient should be amused as much as possible;
the air also was recommended, and, if possible,
a little change of scene. To all these suggestions
prompt and immediate attention was paid.
It was fortunate that the Earl of Smatterton
had a residence in the immediate vicinity of
London, and it was the intention of the family
to spend the Christmas holidays there. It
would therefore be very opportune to afford
the young lady a change of air and scene: for
from her childhood Penelope had never wandered
beyond the two villages of Smatterton
and Neverden. The proposal was made to her
to accompany the family, and the proposal was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
made so kindly, she could not possibly refuse
it, even had it not been agreeable.</p>

<p>There was something perplexing to the inartificial
and unsophisticated mind of Penelope
Primrose, in the wonderful difference between
fashionable manners under different circumstances.
She had not the slightest doubt that Lord
Smatterton and her ladyship were people of high
fashion, nor could she have the least hesitation
in concluding that the Duchess of Steeple Bumstead
was also a woman of high fashion; but
she recollected how rudely the Duchess had
stared at her, and she had also a general feeling
that many more persons of fashion at the select
party had appeared, both in their manner towards
her, and their deportment towards each
other, absolutely disagreeable, unfeeling, and
insolent. There also occurred to her recollection,
amidst other thoughts of a similar nature,
the impertinent and conceited airs which Lord
Spoonbill had exhibited when she had formerly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
met him by accident; and she compared, with
some degree of astonishment, his present very
agreeable with his past very disagreeable manners.</p>

<p>The day on which Lord Smatterton and his
family removed to their suburban villa was the
very day that saw Mr Primrose depart from
Smatterton on his way to London. And if on
this occasion we should, by way of being very
sentimental and pathetic, say, “Little did they
think, the one that the father was coming to
town, and the other that the daughter was leaving
it,”—we should be only saying what our readers
might very readily conjecture to be the case
without any assistance from us: but we should
not be perhaps exceeding the limits of truth.
For, in truth, it was a thought which actually
did enter the mind of Mr Primrose just as he
set out on his journey: feeling somewhat angry
at the disappointment which he had experienced,
he actually said to himself at the very moment
that he entered the chaise: “Now I suppose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
when I get to town, Lord Smatterton and his
family will be gone out of town again.”</p>

<p>It was all very well for the medical attendant
to talk about change of air and change
of scene: men of science know very well that
persons in a certain rank will do what they will,
and so it is not amiss that they should be told
how very suitable and right it is. Change of
scene is pretty enough and wholesome enough
for baby minds that want new playthings; but
no local changes can reach the affliction and
sorrow of heart which sits brooding within.
Penelope found that his lordship’s suburban
villa, though built in the present taste, furnished
with the greatest magnificence, and situated in
one of the most delightful of those ten thousand
beauteous pieces of scenery which surround the
metropolis, was still unable to disperse the
gloom that hung upon her mind, and to reconcile
her to that profession which the imperious
kindness of the Countess of Smatterton had destined
for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span></p>

<p>Lord Spoonbill took infinite pains to render
the change of scene agreeable to the young lady.
The weather was, for the time of year, cheerful
and bright, and though cold, not intensely so:
and in spite of the numerous hints which the
Earl gave him of the impropriety of such excessive
condescension, the heir of Smatterton
would accompany the plebeian dependent in the
chariot, and point out to her the various beauties
of the surrounding scenery. A person who can
see has a great advantage over one that is blind.
Such advantage had Lord Spoonbill over Penelope
Primrose. In her mind there did not exist
the slightest or most distant apprehension whatever
of the design which his lordship had in
these attentions. Had there been such apprehension,
or such suspicion, vain would have
been all his lordship’s endeavours to render
himself agreeable to the young lady. As it
was, however, Penelope certainly began to entertain
a much higher opinion of his lordship’s
good qualities than she had before. He did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
not indeed talk like a philosopher, or utter
oracles, but he manifested kind feelings and
generous sentiments. On many subjects he
talked fluently, though his talk was common-place;
and he perhaps might adapt himself to
the supposed limited information of his companion.
The young lady was also pleased with
the apparent indifference which in his conversation
he manifested to the distinctions of rank.
And as Penelope was pleased with the young
nobleman’s attentions, and grateful for the considerate
and almost unexpected kindness which
she experienced from the Smatterton family,
her manner became less constrained, and, even
though unwell, she was cheerful, and the gracefulness
of gratitude gave to her natural beauty
a charm which heightened and embellished it.
Thus, the beauty by which Lord Spoonbill’s
attention had been first attracted, appeared to
him infinitely more fascinating when connected
with such mental and moral charms: so that,
to use an expression which has no meaning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
but which is generally understood, his lordship
had fairly lost his heart.</p>

<p>The day after the family had departed from
town, the letter which Mr Primrose had sent to
his daughter was, with several others, put into
the magnificent hands of the Right Honorable
the Earl of Smatterton. His lordship did everything
with a grace peculiar to himself; even
the opening of letters was to him a matter of
importance; and his friends have often smiled
at the serious and self-satisfied air with which
he was accustomed to take up the letters one
by one, reading aloud the address before he
broke the seal. There seemed to be something
pleasant to his ear in the sound of the words,
“The Right Honorable the Earl of Smatterton.”
His lordship used generally to open his letters
in the presence of his family; and as it frequently
happened that, under cover to his lordship,
there came letters addressed to members
of his establishment, he used to make a great
ceremony in reading aloud their address also.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
It was curious, we have been told, to hear
the different intonation with which his lordship
uttered the names of his domestics from that
which he used when speaking of his own great
self.</p>

<p>On the present occasion there was only Lord
Spoonbill present when the letters were opened.
And when his lordship had first pompously
read aloud “The Right Honorable the Earl
of Smatterton,” he afterwards, in a lower and
quicker tone, read—“Miss Primrose.” His
lordship then handed the letter to his son,
saying, “Charles, this letter, I perceive, is addressed
to Miss Primrose; cause it immediately
to be delivered to the young woman. At
the same time let me give you a caution. Condescension
to our inferiors is very becoming,
and is one of the brightest jewels in a nobleman’s
coronet: but, Charles, while we condescend
to our inferiors, we should always recollect,
and let them also know, that they are our
inferiors. We should always treat our inferiors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
with kindness, and we may behave to them,
when we admit them to our table, with courteous
politeness. But we must not, and ought
not, by way of shewing our condescension, to
let down and forget our dignity.”</p>

<p>Lord Spoonbill thought more of Miss Primrose’s
pretty face than he did of his own dignity,
and was therefore beginning to grow weary of
this right honorable prosing, and to shew symptoms
of fidgettiness. But when the Earl of
Smatterton had once taken it into his head to
administer the word of exhortation to any of his
family, he was not easily diverted from his purpose
by any expressions or indications of uneasiness
on the part of the patient: therefore
he proceeded.</p>

<p>“Now, Spoonbill, let me as a friend advise
you. I waive my authority and speak to you
purely and simply as a friend. Our title is a
mere empty sound, unless the dignity of it is
properly kept up. You are disposed to be
very condescending, and at home it is all well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
enough; but what I disapprove of is your condescension
in public. Yesterday you accompanied
this young woman in the chariot, and
it is impossible to say who may have seen you
thus familiarly associating with a person of inferior
rank. There are too many encroachments
already upon the higher classes, and we ought
not to invite and encourage more. I have
done.”</p>

<p>Lord Spoonbill was glad to hear that. But
the disobedient one, as if his only object in
listening to a sermon had been that he might
act directly contrary to its advice, forthwith,
instead of causing the letter to be delivered,
did himself, with his own right honorable
hands, in person present the letter to Penelope.</p>

<p>“Who should write to me?” thought the dependent,
as she received the letter with a smile of
gratitude and gracefulness from the condescending
son of the dignified Earl of Smatterton.
Lord Spoonbill thought that Penelope had never
before looked so graceful and so beautiful as at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
that moment. There are some countenances
in which peculiar and transient emotions light
up a most fascinating expression of loveliness.
This peculiarity belonged to Penelope; and that
look of loveliness rewarded Lord Spoonbill for
his condescension, and made a much deeper impression
on his heart than the discourse of the
Earl had made on his understanding. So impressive
was it that it almost enchained him to
the spot, so as to prevent Penelope from immediately
gratifying her curiosity by perusing the
letter. His lordship, as if to find reason, or to
make cause for prolonging his stay, said:</p>

<p>“If this letter requires an answer by return
of post, my father will be happy to give you a
frank; but the post closes at three, and it is
now past twelve.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, my lord,” replied the young
lady, looking at the letter and half opening it;
“I do not know from whence it comes.”</p>

<p>In a few seconds the letter was opened, and
the quick glancing eye of Penelope saw the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
name of Primrose, and the whole truth rushed
into her mind with overpowering violence; and
the intense feeling of delight at the thought
of being saved from dependence and rescued
from a dreaded profession, was too much for
her weakened spirits to bear composedly, and
exclaiming, with hysteric shriek, “My father,
my father!” she would have sunk on the floor
had not Lord Spoonbill caught her in his arms
and placed her on a sofa. His lordship rang
violently for assistance, which was promptly
and successfully rendered; and as his presence
was no farther necessary, he thought it best to
inform the Countess of the situation of Miss
Primrose, and of the event which had produced
this sudden burst of feeling.</p>

<p>Now, generally speaking, the Countess of
Smatterton was a lady of great humanity and
considerateness; but when anything occurred to
interfere with or interrupt a favourite scheme,
her natural tenderness was much abated. It
presently came into her mind that the arrival of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
Mr Primrose in England would prevent the purposed
exhibition of Penelope’s musical talents,
and this thought afflicted her and made her
almost angry. Nevertheless, her ladyship immediately
went to Miss Primrose and offered
her congratulations on the happy event. These
congratulations the young lady, in the simplicity
of her heart, believed to be sincere, and
she made her acknowledgments accordingly;
but she was very much surprised at the manner
in which the Countess received these acknowledgments.</p>

<p>Penelope, when left alone, read over her
father’s letter with more composed and settled
delight, and it was an unspeakable relief to
her mind that now, from the language of this
communication, she had reason to be satisfied
that there was no danger that she should be
